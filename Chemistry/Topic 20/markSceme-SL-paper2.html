<p>Most students scored well on naming the required compound from its formula in Part (a), likewise defining structural isomers and recognising compounds related in the way, required in Part (b), were rarely a challenge. In Part (c) students could usually identify whether compounds underwent oxidation and the products formed, with the most common mistake being to fail to notice that there was excess dichromate(VI) in the case of the primary alcohol. The mechanism required in Part (d) seemed to be known to many, though many candidates continue to lose marks through a lack of precision about the start and finish points of curly arrows. Many students gained at least one mark for the definition standard enthalpy change in the first section of Part (e), though few displayed the precision required for both marks. In the second section quite a few tried to solve the enthalpy problem by calorimetry rather than using the enthalpy of reaction that had been given. Generally speaking the next section, that did require calorimetry, was better done though the calculation of the amount of reagent and using the mass of liquid rather than solid for the heat evolved proved a challenge for some. Many candidates correctly combined their results, sometimes invoking Hess&rsquo; Law, in the final section, though many candidates benefited from the application of ECF.</p>

<p>Question 7 was answered by relatively few candidates, and those who chose this question were usually not well-prepared. In (a) very few candidates indicated that HCl is a strong acid and \({\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{COOH}}\) a weak one. Many candidates seemed unfamiliar with the distinction between state and outline and simply said that HCl would be a better conductor. In (b)(i) very few candidates could state a correct equation for the reaction between ethanoic acid and sodium hydrogencarbonate, even when the formulas were provided, but most could calculate the limiting reagent in (b)(ii) and the mass of \({\text{C}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\) produced in (b)(iii). Part (c) gave details of a volatile organic liquid. Most candidates could calculate the moles of gas present in (c)(i), although the conversion to the correct units for pressure and volume gave many problems. The calculation of the molar mass of the gas, especially with ECF applied, was generally done well by the candidates. Part (d) referred to the substitution reaction of bromoethane to form ethanol. Identifying the reagent in (d)(i) for this reaction caused problems, with many stating \({\text{O}}{{\text{H}}^ - }\) as the reagent instead of NaOH or KOH. Only the best candidates could draw the mechanism for this substitution reaction in (d)(ii). Many candidates seemed to have very little idea of how to represent an \({{\text{S}}_{\text{N}}}{\text{2}}\) mechanism. Although most candidates identified HBr as the reagent which could produce bromoethane from ethene, they often gave UV as the required condition in (e)(i). Teachers should note that assessment statement 10.6.1 indicates that reagents, conditions and equations should be included for all reaction types listed in the syllabus. Calculation of the enthalpy change using bond enthalpies did not give problems to the good candidates in (e)(ii) but many of the weaker candidates failed to identify all the bonds broken and formed, and only scored the final mark through the application of ECF. Drawing a section of a polymer produced from bromoethene in (e)(iii) presented few problems for most candidates.</p>

<p class="p1">This was the least popular of the Section B questions. (a) (i) was poorly answered. Many candidates had no idea and some candidates used the mass of ethanol instead of water. A few calculated correctly but failed to convert the mass of water to kg, or kJ to J, thereby ending up with the wrong unit for the answer. Only a small minority of candidates got (ii) correct. (iii) was well answered. Nearly all candidates referred to heat loss but only the better candidates were able to give a second reason.</p>

<p class="p1">(c) was usually well done, but some candidates struggled with the structural formula of the ether isomer of \({{\text{C}}_{\text{4}}}{{\text{H}}_{{\text{10}}}}{\text{O}}\) in (v).</p>
<p class="p1">One G2 comment stated that the ether functional group is not listed as one of the formal functional groups in Topic 10, which is correct. However, this aspect has been asked previously on SL papers in relation to deducing specific isomers (rather than naming the ether group) and although candidates are not required to know that C-O-C is the ether functional group, there is an expectation that they should be able to deduce an isomer based on C-O-C, as this is cited explicitly in AS 4.3.2, in the teacher&rsquo;s notes in relation to \({\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{OC}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}\) and \({\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{OH}}\), making this very much an objective 3 question, linking concepts across the syllabus.</p>

<p class="p1">The main G2 comments on this question related to the inclusion of organic chemistry in Section A. It should be noted that ANY Topic can be asked in Section A of P2, and there is no set-formula in relation to question setting. Organic chemistry is an integral part of the IB SL Chemistry programme, and is covered in Topic 10 of the guide (12 hours in total). Hence, candidates should be adequately prepared for questions on this topic, even in Section A. In 3(a), the Lewis structure of chlorethene was generally drawn correctly, though the weaker candidates often omitted the lone pairs on the chlorine. The bond angle was usually predicted, although right angles and 109.5&deg;<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>were often given. Even some of the better candidates explained their choice of bond angle, based on the fact that the double bond occupies more space causing the HCCl bond angle to drop less than 120&deg;.</p>

<p class="p1">Most knew the meaning of the symbols S<sub><span class="s1">N</span></sub>2, however, a few did not correctly state the meaning of the 2. The mechanism caused some problems and some of the common errors here were drawing the curly arrow from the H; forgetting to include any curly arrow to show Br leaving; writing the partial bond from the nucleophile as OH---C; or missing the negative charge from the transition state. Unfortunately, most candidates had a combination of these errors. Also, in most cases the partial bonds were drawn at angles less than 180 degrees which, although not penalised, is totally incorrect as attack by the nucleophile must be on the opposite side to the halogen leaving.</p>

<p class="p1">Part (f) proved to be very confusing for many candidates. The structural isomers of propan-1-ol were commonly drawn as propan-1-ol and propan-2-ol, which then caused enormous difficulties in 5(f)(ii) when they had to identify the isomer with the higher boiling point.</p>
<p class="p1">Those who were relying on ECF marks here often predicted the wrong isomer or found it very difficult to explain their prediction. The few candidates who drew the isomers correctly as an ether and an alcohol were generally able to score full marks by predicting and explaining the different boiling points.</p>

<p>Probably the most popular and successfully answered. Most students were family with IUPAC nomenclature and realised that UV radiation is required to initiate the halogenation of an alkane, though fewer realised that the much greater probability of forming a different isomer, or the problem of polysubstitution would result in a very low yield. The conditions for the hydrolysis of the bromoalkane were well known, though fewer recognised it as a tertiary halogenoalkane and described the \({{\text{S}}_{\text{N}}}{\text{1}}\) reaction mechanism. Only a small number of candidates were able to show the electron pair originating from C&ndash;Br bond or the lone pair on the oxygen or negative charge of the hydroxide ion. Many candidates knew that tertiary alcohols could not be oxidised and correctly drew primary structures for alcohols that could be oxidised to carboxylic acids although some made careless errors and drew secondary structures or did not answer the question and proposed aldehydes. Many candidates were able to determine the enthalpy change, from bond enthalpies but some had not read the question carefully and did not address the final mark. A significant number of candidates made small errors but still gained ECF marks as they had set their working out clearly. The calculation of the amount of fuel required to raise the temperature proved more difficult with many students overlooking the volume of water and using the data to calculate the mass of the hydrocarbon that would be heated by 80 &deg;C by the molar enthalpy of combustion and using the specific heat capacity of water.</p>

<p>The required definition and the effect of acid on the oxidizing power of \({\text{Ti}}{{\text{O}}^{2 + }}\) was often well done, though it proved a challenge for some candidates, and most could interpret the change in terms of oxidation numbers. Very few candidates could use \({E^\Theta }\) values to predict whether a reaction with another half-cell would occur and even less could correctly combine the half-equations to produce a balanced equation for the overall reaction. Relatively few candidates managed to gain full marks for the questions relating to the voltaic cell illustrated, with the different parts appearing to be of approximately equal difficulty. The nature of the period 3 oxides was generally well appreciated, though often the effect on pH was expressed as, for example, &ldquo;basic&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;increases&rdquo;. In spite of the efficiency of modern plants many considered the contact process to be a major source of sulfur dioxide pollution, rather than combustion of coal and other &ldquo;high sulfur&rdquo; fossil fuels. The comparison of the structure of silicon dioxide to those of carbon and xenon dioxides was poorly done, the root cause often being a lack of awareness of the structure of silicon dioxide. Many candidates could however write correct equations for the reaction of silicon tetrachloride with water.</p>

<p>Most students could identify an element which would be expected to have similar properties to antimony and the reaction between its fluoride and hydrogen fluoride was generally well interpreted in terms of acid-base theories, though hardly any students realized that HF is acting as both a base (to give \({{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{F}}^ + }\)) and an acid (to give \({{\text{F}}^ - }\) which complexes with \({\text{As}}{{\text{F}}_{\text{5}}}\)). The significance of the strength of the hydrogen-halogen bond on the strength of the hydrogen halides was often appreciated though very few seemed to realize that HF hydrogen bonds to water whereas HCl does not. Many students think that weak acids require a smaller volume of alkali for neutralization than strong acids of equal concentration, though most could correctly identify an appropriate indicator for the titration and justify their choice. Most realized that sulfuric acid was dibasic, were aware of the significance of the pH at the half equivalence point and correctly identified HQ as a weak acid, though justifying this proved more of a challenge. Quite a few students gained full credit the calculation of the \({\text{p}}{K_{\text{a}}}\) from the initial pH and many gained some marks for the calculation of the pH of the buffer system.</p>

<p>Generally candidates found this question quite challenging and some left quite a number of parts unanswered. The tradition is that the first question on the paper is a data response question, which often addresses many aspects of the syllabus, and unfortunately candidates, especially those of average or below average ability, seem to have difficulty in tackling questions of this nature. One other issue with data response questions is that, of necessity, the data appears at the beginning of the question whilst, mainly because of the space left for candidates to answer, the later parts of the question referring to these data may not appear until a number of pages into the paper.</p>
<p>Part (a) concerning density, volume and amount of substance was generally reasonably well answered, but the following parts, concerning uncertainties, were rarely answered correctly and a number confused precision (uncertainty, either absolute or as a percentage) and accuracy (percentage error in the value obtained). Many candidates also seemed to lack experimental common sense, simply taking an average that included an initial titre that was much larger than the concordant second and third titres, rather than excluding it. This lack of experimental &ldquo;know how&rdquo; was also evident in responses to (c) (iii) where it was unusual for the approach to the question to indicate the candidate had realised that the alkali was neutralising two different acids (HCl and \({\text{C}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{COOH}}\)) and again in part (d) where it was rare for the response to outline a practical solution to the problem, though quite a number of candidates suggested that the pH would become constant, presumably not realising that the pH would be dominated by the HCl catalyst. Most students could however carry out the more routine tasks of writing an equilibrium constant expression and determining its value from the data given. Many candidates were aware of Le Chatelier effects on the position of equilibrium, but a significant number failed to use this information to answer the question actually asked and the unusual approach to the effect of temperature disconcerted many. Whilst most students managed to identify the ester as the component of the mixture that was insoluble in water, the reasons given were usually couched in terms of the polarity of the molecule (many quite polar molecules, halogenoalkanes for example, are insoluble in water) rather than its inability to form strong hydrogen bonds to water, which is the critical factor. Quite a number of students came up with a valid reason why water would not be a suitable solvent, though some students appeared to have overlooked the fact the question stated &ldquo;other reason&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="p1">Question 7 was a popular one and well-answered in general. Part (a) required definitions which were not well known but most candidates determined the empirical and molecular formulas and correctly drew the structural formula of the carboxylic acid. Fewer candidates could correctly draw the structural formula of an ester. Identification of the stronger and longer carbon-oxygen bond was answered correctly by nearly all candidates, but explaining the bond lengths in the propanoate ion was only answered correctly by the very best candidates. Even those who realized that the electrons are delocalized did not give a complete explanation and often scored only 2 marks out of 3.</p>

<p>(i)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most candidates were able to calculate the relative atomic mass to the correct number of decimal places.</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Only strong candidates were able to predict the same radius for the isotopes and gave correct reasoning. However, the majority of candidates predicted that a larger number of neutrons resulted is a smaller radius, reflecting a poor understanding of atomic structure.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>(i)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very few candidates were able to explain the increase in successive ionization energies for electrons removed from the same sub-shell. Many candidates gave incorrect reasoning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The increase between the 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> ionization energies of magnesium was explained correctly by about half of the candidates. Few candidates scored the first mark by identifying the correct shells or sub-shells the electrons are removed from.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="question_part_label">b.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>(i)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well answered by many candidates. A few candidates were confusing ionic with covalent bonding, and some referred to a linear MgO molecule in an ionic lattice.</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Few candidates were able to describe the covalent bond precisely. Those who didn&rsquo;t score usually didn&rsquo;t make any reference to pairs of electrons.</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many candidates obtained this mark with satisfactory arguments. It was disappointing to see the abundance of answers based on &ldquo;is a metal with a non-metal&rdquo; or &ldquo;both are non-metals&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">c.</div>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>(i) &nbsp; &nbsp; A few candidates identified sp hybridization based on a linear structure. Only the strongest candidates were able to give the correct hybridization for oxygen as well.</p>
<p>(ii) &nbsp; &nbsp; This was the most challenging question on the paper. It was rare to see a correct answer. It seems candidates did not have a good understanding of hybridization.</p>
<p>(iii) &nbsp; &nbsp; Less than half the candidates were able to define electronegativity precisely. Many candidates did not relate it to the pair of electrons in a covalent bond, and simply talked about attracting electrons, which was not sufficient for the mark.</p>
<p>(iv) &nbsp; &nbsp; Many candidates gained the first mark by stating that oxygen has more protons than carbon. But very few candidates identified the second factor, which is the smaller radius of oxygen.</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p class="p1">Most candidates knew about the relative conductivities of magnesium chloride and phosphorous trichloride and were able to relate it to bonding. The third mark was however more problematic as many continue to equate conductivity to mobile electrons rather than ions. The pH of solutions of aqueous chlorides was not generally well known with only a small number of candidates gaining full marks. An explanation of the acidity of magnesium in terms of the charge density of the \({\text{M}}{{\text{g}}^{2 + }}\) ion proved to be particularly challenging. One teacher commented that the reaction of \({\text{PC}}{{\text{l}}_{\text{3}}}\) and water is not mentioned in the guide but it is included in the teacher note to Assessment statement 13.1.1 of the current guide (although it is not in the new guide which will be assessed for the first time in May 2016). The acidity of the period 3 oxides was generally well known but many struggled to give balanced equations to describe the reactions of sodium and phosphorous(V) oxide with water, with many confusing the reaction of sodium oxide with that of sodium giving hydrogen as a product. Most candidates were able to give correct Lewis structure and shapes and bond angles but marks were lost, as in previous session due to missing lone pairs either on the central atoms or the Br and F atoms. It should be noted that it is difficult to award ECF marks in these questions so students need to avoid careless errors. Many struggled to give a complete explanation of the polarity of the two compounds as although the molecule was identified as being asymmetrical, few stated that the P&ndash;Br and S&ndash;F bonds are polar. Only a minority of students stated that a covalent bond was an attraction between nuclei and a pair of electrons and many were unable to identify the s-orbital from hydrogen and the \({\text{p/s}}{{\text{p}}^{\text{2}}}\) orbital from carbon as the overlapping orbitals in the covalent bond. The hybridisation of oxygen was generally well known as was sigma and pi bonding.</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p class="p1">The Lewis structures were usually well drawn but some omitted the lone pairs. The shapes were also usually correct, though some stated that the shape of \({\text{PB}}{{\text{r}}_{\text{3}}}\) is tetrahedral which is incorrect. The electron domain geometry of \({\text{PB}}{{\text{r}}_{\text{3}}}\) is tetrahedral as there are four negative charge centres or four electron domains, but the molecular geometry and hence the shape is trigonal/triangular pyramidal. It is worth emphasising this difference between electron domain geometry and molecular geometry in discussions of shape in VSEPR Theory. As regards the bond angles, a few forgot the fact that the lone pair on the P occupies more space and hence the angle drops below 109.5 degrees. Many simply wrote 107 degrees, which is the bond angle in ammonia. An important point to make here is that every trigonal pyramidal geometry does not have a bond angle equivalent to that of ammonia, 107 degrees, which is a point often misunderstood by candidates. In fact, many factors can come into play here including lone pairs and electronegativity considerations. In fact, the experimental bond angle for \({\text{PB}}{{\text{r}}_{\text{3}}}\) is 101 degrees and candidates would have scored the mark if they gave any value in the range 100 to less than 109.5 degrees. Candidates are not required to know experimental values but should not make sweeping conclusions that all trigonal pyramidal geometries have 107 degree bond angles, which certainly is not the case. For \({\text{S}}{{\text{F}}_{\text{6}}}\), 90 and 120 bond angles were often incorrectly given. The most disappointing part of this sub-section however was the poor explanations of polarity. Some of the top candidates did however give complete explanations and referred to the polar PBr bonds and the fact that as the molecule is not symmetrical there is an asymmetric distribution of the electron cloud. It was nice to see vectorial addition of bond dipoles supporting this type of explanation resulting in a clearly defined and drawn net dipole moment in the case of \({\text{PB}}{{\text{r}}_{\text{3}}}\) leading to its polar nature and similar arguments and drawings in the case of the non-polar of \({\text{S}}{{\text{F}}_{\text{6}}}\).</p>

In part (b) many students seemed to be aware of the difference between strong and weak acids, but few could use this to answer the question asked and frequently, even having displayed this knowledge, were unable to write an equation for the required reaction in water. Unfortunately changes in pagination meant that the phrase &ldquo;<em>the equilibrium above</em>&rdquo; in part (b) (iii) may have confused candidates with regard to which particular equilibrium the question referred to. Fortunately both of the equilibria that it could have referred to change in the same direction and students scored well on this, and both would eventually result in the release of chlorine, that a number recognized as a toxic gas. In contrast to Question 1, many students could correctly identify the hydrogen bonding, resulting from the &ndash;OH group, as being the reason for the solubility of HOCl in water. An encouraging number of students gained full marks for calculating the pH of the buffer, usually by memorizing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and substituting in this. An even greater number of students could accurately explain the mode of action of acid-base indicators. In part (c) very few students could write, much less combine, appropriate half equations, even though the reactants and products were given, but far more could correctly deduce the oxidation numbers of the species involved.

In part (b) many students seemed to be aware of the difference between strong and weak acids, but few could use this to answer the question asked and frequently, even having displayed this knowledge, were unable to write an equation for the required reaction in water. Unfortunately changes in pagination meant that the phrase &ldquo;<em>the equilibrium above</em>&rdquo; in part (b) (iii) may have confused candidates with regard to which particular equilibrium the question referred to. Fortunately both of the equilibria that it could have referred to change in the same direction and students scored well on this, and both would eventually result in the release of chlorine, that a number recognized as a toxic gas. In contrast to Question 1, many students could correctly identify the hydrogen bonding, resulting from the &ndash;OH group, as being the reason for the solubility of HOCl in water. An encouraging number of students gained full marks for calculating the pH of the buffer, usually by memorizing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and substituting in this. An even greater number of students could accurately explain the mode of action of acid-base indicators. In part (c) very few students could write, much less combine, appropriate half equations, even though the reactants and products were given, but far more could correctly deduce the oxidation numbers of the species involved. In the final part most students had some general idea of what a standard electrode potential was, but in many cases the definitions lacked the detail required. Quite a few students correctly deduced that the oxidation of chromium(III) to dichromate(VI) was energetically feasible and give valid reasons to support this.</p>

<p>Many students could recall the reagents for the hydration of an alkene and recognize the alcohol as a tertiary alcohol that would not undergo oxidation. Statements regarding optical activity often lacked precision and betrayed confusion with chirality. Very few could correctly describe how a polarimeter worked, especially the second rotating sheet of polaroid, and students frequently drew the structure of 2-methylbutan-2-ol rather than its chiral isomer. Most students stated that the alcohol was more polar than the alkene, but fewer mentioned that it could form hydrogen bonds to water and even less linked this to the presence of the hydroxyl group. Almost all students recognized that the hydrolysis was \({{\text{S}}_{\text{N}}}{\text{1}}\), with an encouraging number being able to write reasonable mechanisms, though many still lost marks through a lack of precision in where their curly arrows started and ended. Many candidates also stated an appropriate rate equation along with the units of the rate constant. Very few students linked the difference of two molar mass units to the presence in the molecule of chlorine, with its naturally occurring isotopes, and the discussion of any effect on the hydrolysis rate often revealed a lack of clear thinking. In contrast many students correctly identified the nitrile as the intermediate in the chain extension reaction and reagents for its formation and hydrogenation were generally well known.</p>

<p>Many students could recall the reagents for the hydration of an alkene and recognize the alcohol as a tertiary alcohol that would not undergo oxidation. Statements regarding optical activity often lacked precision and betrayed confusion with chirality. Very few could correctly describe how a polarimeter worked, especially the second rotating sheet of polaroid, and students frequently drew the structure of 2-methylbutan-2-ol rather than its chiral isomer. Most students stated that the alcohol was more polar than the alkene, but fewer mentioned that it could form hydrogen bonds to water and even less linked this to the presence of the hydroxyl group. Almost all students recognized that the hydrolysis was \({{\text{S}}_{\text{N}}}{\text{1}}\), with an encouraging number being able to write reasonable mechanisms, though many still lost marks through a lack of precision in where their curly arrows started and ended. Many candidates also stated an appropriate rate equation along with the units of the rate constant. Very few students linked the difference of two molar mass units to the presence in the molecule of chlorine, with its naturally occurring isotopes, and the discussion of any effect on the hydrolysis rate often revealed a lack of clear thinking. In contrast many students correctly identified the nitrile as the intermediate in the chain extension reaction and reagents for its formation and hydrogenation were generally well known.</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p class="p1">For (b) VSEPR theory in general was well answered. The most common mistakes involved candidates failing to include square brackets or lone pairs of electrons or charges. Four G2 comments stated that expanded octets are not on the syllabus. However, AS 14.1.1 states explicitly that candidates should be able to predict the shape and bond angles of species of five and six negative charge centres. Four examples are included in the teachers note, including \({\text{S}}{{\text{F}}_{\text{6}}}\), but it has to emphasized again, as in previous subject reports that examples should not be confined in teaching programmes to just these four examples. Even \({\text{S}}{{\text{F}}_{\text{6}}}\) is a clear example of an expanded octet type structure, as is \({\text{SiF}}_6^{2 - }\), as asked in this question.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">b.i.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p class="p1">There were five other G2 comments again stating the fact that \({\text{NO}}_2^ + \) is off-syllabus. Based on AS 4.2.7, this example is clearly on the syllabus as the AS states that candidates should be able to predict the shape and bond angles of species of two, three and four negative charge centres. All the examples in the teachers note should be covered at a minimum in the teaching programme, but these are not the only examples.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">b.ii.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p class="p1">There were seven G2 comments referring to (d); some respondents felt that the candidates had to answer the question by determining the shape of both \({\text{N}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\) and\({\text{C}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\)<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>using VSEPR Theory. This is a classic example of candidates reading the question carefully and not making unnecessary assumptions in relation to what is being asked. Only three marks are allocated to this question and hence this should be another clue as to suggest that the answer can be given in a concise manner. All candidates had to do was determine the fact that both species are XY<span class="s1">2 </span>species (not XYZ even) and hence can only be one of two geometries, either linear or bent. \({\text{C}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\) must be non-polar since it is a linear geometry and hence the two dipole moments cancel each other out, yielding a net dipole moment of zero. In the case of \({\text{N}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\), the geometry must be bent, and therefore there is a net dipole moment meaning it is a polar molecule. A simple diagram of the two species with the two bond dipole moments in each case and the resultant net dipole moment (in the case of \({\text{N}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}}}\)) would have scored both marks. There was no need to show lone pairs of electrons or isolated electrons etc. to answer this question, as candidates were not asked to write Lewis structures etc. Some candidates wasted time here trying to work these out and even some candidates thought that there might even be a mistake in the question and tried to answer the question with \({\text{NO}}_2^ - \), because this is an example given in the teachers note in AS 14.3.1, based on delocalization.</p>
<p class="p1">The very best candidates did draw dipole moments, as the question did ask for diagrams, when explaining polarity, as opposed to simply a description in words.</p>

<p class="p1">For (iv) one G2 comment stated that the hybridization of N in \({\text{HCON}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}\) will in fact be \({\text{s}}{{\text{p}}^{\text{2}}}\) due to the planar nature of the \({\text{N}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}\) group here in this example, which is in fact correct, although it is unlikely that candidates at this level would know this. Nearly all candidates gave \({\text{s}}{{\text{p}}^{\text{3}}}\) hybridization for N, which they based on a perceived pyramidal type geometry, like in ammonia. For this reason, during GA, we decided to allow both hybridizations, even though the correct answer is actually \({\text{s}}{{\text{p}}^{\text{2}}}\) in this example.</p>

In addition, a significant number of candidates showed poor understanding of Hund‟s Rule of Maximum Multiplicity which states that when degenerate orbitals are available, electrons fill the orbitals singly before filling them in pairs. Hence, in many cases incorrect representations were seen for the 3d which involved three pairs of electrons of opposite spin being inserted in three 3d orbitals. Most candidates stated the \({\text{C}}{{\text{o}}^{2 + }}\) ion, though a common incorrect answer was \({\text{C}}{{\text{o}}^{4 + }}\).

This question was asked a number of times in previous examinations and previously was typically really very poorly answered.

<p>This was the most popular of the Section B questions, which was surprising because it was often not well answered. Most students were aware of the change involved in ionization, some realised this relates to the most easily lost electron, some that it refers to gas phase changes and a few both. Explanations of the changes in the values of successive ionization energies in terms of the attraction of the nucleus and the repulsion from other electrons were generally weak, however candidates quite often recognised that the third electron lost had to come from a more stable electron energy level. Very few were able to correctly sum the enthalpy terms involved in the Born-Haber cycle, in addition candidates rarely halved the bond enthalpy of chlorine and a significant number appeared not to realise the question referred to MgCl rather than \({\text{MgC}}{{\text{l}}_2}\). There were some G2 comments that space should have been left for students to draw a cycle, but this would have implied that such a drawing was required, hence it is better to train students to use additional paper for any background support they may require. Quite a lot of students correctly deduced the order of lattice enthalpy of the group (II) halides, and a number correctly explained this in terms of ionic radii, though many incorrectly invoked electronegativities. Many students could correctly explain the effect of pH on the solubility of \({\text{Mg(OH}}{{\text{)}}_{\text{2}}}\), though a significant number attempted to answer the opposite question; how pH would depend on the concentration of dissolved \({\text{Mg(OH}}{{\text{)}}_{\text{2}}}\)! It was surprising how few students could correctly describe metallic bonding, how it is affected by the number of delocalized electrons per cation and the way it leads to malleability. Alloys are not specifically mentioned in the syllabus but the mark scheme gave credit for answers that indicated the student was aware that malleability is associated with layers of metal atoms/cations sliding over each other. Most students were able to draw appropriately labelled diagrams of electrolysis apparatus, though sometimes the labelling of the polarity of the electrodes did not correspond to the polarity of the battery symbol drawn. Quite a few candidates could quote equations for the reactions occurring the electrodes in both the liquid and aqueous state; both seemed to be equally well answered which was perhaps a little surprisingly. Many could also give good explanations as to why electrolysis of the aqueous solution did not produce magnesium metal, though confusions in terminology (such as hydrogen rather than hydrogen ions being reduced) were not uncommon.</p>

<p class="p1">Most candidates were able to draw an arrow in the box diagram for the electron configuration of chromium, but few gave a complete description of the nature of metallic bonding and did not refer to the attraction between the \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}^{3 + }}\) cations and the delocalized electrons. Candidates were more successful in explaining malleability in terms of \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}^{3 + }}\) cations sliding over one another. Most candidates were able to use oxidation numbers in naming \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\) but the explanation of ionic bonding was incomplete with only limited reference to the electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged ions. Students continue to struggle to understand that conductivity of molten ionic compounds is due to mobile ions not electrons. Most candidates were able to deduce the oxidation number in the complex ion and give the answer using the correct notation. The nature of the ligand-chromium bond was well known and the explanation of the colour of transition metal complexes was stronger than in previous sessions with only a minority referring to the emission of light. Some teachers have commented that trans/cis-isomers of the complex ions is not specifically stated in the guide but many students were able draw two possible isomers. The representation of 3D structures could have been clearer although this was not explicitly penalized. Redox half-reactions continue to challenge many with only the stronger students being able to gain both marks and deduce the correct overall equation. Some teachers commented that the question was too demanding as students had to construct two half-equations in order to get to the overall redox equation, but the \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}_{\text{7}}^{{\text{2}} - }{\text{/C}}{{\text{r}}^{3 + }}\) half-reaction is given in table 14 of the current data booklet. The majority of candidates identified the conversion of \({{\text{I}}^ - }\) to \({\text{I}}{{\text{O}}^{3 - }}\) as oxidation and many able to identify the increase in oxidation number. The workings of a voltaic cell was generally well understood but the definition of the term standard electrode potential was often incomplete with the reference to standard conditions of the hydrogen electrode often missing.</p>

<p class="p1">Most candidates were able to draw an arrow in the box diagram for the electron configuration of chromium, but few gave a complete description of the nature of metallic bonding and did not refer to the attraction between the \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}^{3 + }}\) cations and the delocalized electrons. Candidates were more successful in explaining malleability in terms of \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}^{3 + }}\) cations sliding over one another. Most candidates were able to use oxidation numbers in naming \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{3}}}\) but the explanation of ionic bonding was incomplete with only limited reference to the electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged ions. Students continue to struggle to understand that conductivity of molten ionic compounds is due to mobile ions not electrons. Most candidates were able to deduce the oxidation number in the complex ion and give the answer using the correct notation. The nature of the ligand-chromium bond was well known and the explanation of the colour of transition metal complexes was stronger than in previous sessions with only a minority referring to the emission of light. Some teachers have commented that trans/cis-isomers of the complex ions is not specifically stated in the guide but many students were able draw two possible isomers. The representation of 3D structures could have been clearer although this was not explicitly penalized. Redox half-reactions continue to challenge many with only the stronger students being able to gain both marks and deduce the correct overall equation. Some teachers commented that the question was too demanding as students had to construct two half-equations in order to get to the overall redox equation, but the \({\text{C}}{{\text{r}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O}}_{\text{7}}^{{\text{2}} - }{\text{/C}}{{\text{r}}^{3 + }}\) half-reaction is given in table 14 of the current data booklet. The majority of candidates identified the conversion of \({{\text{I}}^ - }\) to \({\text{I}}{{\text{O}}^{3 - }}\) as oxidation and many able to identify the increase in oxidation number. The workings of a voltaic cell was generally well understood but the definition of the term standard electrode potential was often incomplete with the reference to standard conditions of the hydrogen electrode often missing.</p>

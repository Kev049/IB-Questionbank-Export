<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p class="p1">This was the second least commonly answered question. With the exception of the part on buffer chemistry where very few appreciated what was happening, the question was reasonably well done.</p>
<p class="p1">While many candidates gave the correct \({K_{\text{w}}}\) expression, it was not uncommon to either find the value of the constant or \({K_{\text{w}}} = {K_{\text{a}}} \times {K_{\text{b}}}\) given as the answers. A few included \({\text{[}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{O]}}\) in the expression. Candidates recognised that increasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium to the right, but most did not explain why, namely to use up some of the heat supplied.</p>
<p class="p1">Candidates generally concluded that formation of more \({{\text{H}}^ + }\) and \({\text{O}}{{\text{H}}^ - }\) ions gives a higher value of \({K_{\text{w}}}\). A significant number of candidates were able to state the effect of increasing temperature on the pH of water (it decreases) but failed to explain why. Some simply incorrectly stated that the pH would not change.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p class="p1">Many candidates gave the wrong formulas for the acid and the conjugate base <strong>ions </strong>of the buffer or offered \({\text{Na}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{P}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{4}}}\) and \({\text{N}}{{\text{a}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{HP}}{{\text{O}}_{\text{4}}}\) as the answers. Some candidates gave good answers about the effect of adding a small amount of a strong acid or a strong base, but they could not write correct equations to show these two effects.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">b.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p class="p1">Nearly all candidates correctly said that the ammonia solution is a weak base because of partial dissociation and \({\text{[O}}{{\text{H}}^ - }{\text{]}}\) would be less than 0.1 to give a pH less than 13. The majority of candidates correctly identified the pH around 4 &ndash; 6 because it is a titration between a strong acid and a weak base. When writing the equation for the reaction of ammonia and water some candidates did not write the equilibrium sign. The \({K_{\text{b}}}\) expression was correct in most cases. However, many did not recognise that at the half-equivalence point both the base and the conjugate acid concentrations are equal. The \({\text{p}}{K_{\text{b}}}\) and \({K_{\text{b}}}\) were correctly calculated from the pH of the solution by many candidates. However, most failed to realize that at the half-equivalence point the capacity of the buffer is optimum.</p>

<p class="p1">There is a difference, which candidates should note, between &ldquo;not fully dissociated&rdquo; and &ldquo;partially dissociated&rdquo; when describing a weak acid. The latter is correct; the former is not accepted as it could mean anything between 1% and 99%. In (ii), many did not state the difference in behaviour of the two acids. Many gained the first mark in (b) for finding the concentration of ethanoic acid. Thereafter either full marks was obtained &ndash; or there was total confusion. The equivalence point in (c) was better known than the \({\text{p}}{K_{\text{a}}}\) where an explanation was expected. The best candidates annotated the graph. Almost all candidates identified phenolphthalein in (ii) correctly but in (iii) any answer that did not begin with an equation was likely to score zero. In questions such as (d) (i), candidates should avoid writing a balanced equation (and there were many) unless the actual answer is clearly indicated. Many were able to identify the stronger acid with the correct reason but in (iii) there were few successful conclusions, many not having recognized that a buffer solution was formed. In (e), most were able to explain why chlorine is in group 7, but the explanation for the period, when it was given, often omitted the idea of <em>occupied </em>shells. In (f), it was disappointing to note that many thought \({\text{SC}}{{\text{l}}_{\text{2}}}\) to be linear and \({\text{SCl}}{{\text{F}}_{\text{5}}}\) trigonal bipyramidal or square pyramidal. Two respondents commented that the column headed &ldquo;polarity&rdquo; was confusing; although we could have expressed this more clearly, the candidates did not seem to have a difficulty with this.</p>

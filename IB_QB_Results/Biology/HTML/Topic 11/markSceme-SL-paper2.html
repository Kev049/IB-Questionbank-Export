<h2 style="margin-top: 1em">Examiners report</h2>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>There were many good drawings. However, there were too many sloppy ones. Often the sperm duct and urethra were shown without double lines. The physical proximity and connections of sperm duct, prostate gland, and urethra were usually drawn incorrectly. In a few cases the female reproductive system was drawn.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>DNA profiling for paternity cases was answered well by many candidates. However, many had the procedures quite poorly sequenced. Little attention was given to selectively breaking up the DNA, or use of restriction enzymes. Weaker answers would have benefitted from more precise terminology such as DNA fragments or DNA bands rather than just DNA. There was fair understanding of gel electrophoresis. Many candidates missed out as they failed to mention DNA from the mother must be used as well as DNA from father and child. Almost no responses included why one might do this process.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">b.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Inheritance of colour blindness seemed to be pretty well answered by many. There was better attention to correct notation than in the past. There was good use of annotated Punnett grids to clarify answers. However, the candidate needed to label or explain the Punnett grid in order to earn marks. It was surprising that many did not include the genotypes in their explanations. Marks were lost by incorrect use of the term gene when allele should have been used.</p>

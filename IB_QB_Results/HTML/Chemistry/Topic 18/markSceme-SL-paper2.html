<p>This was, by far and away, the most common choice for Section B.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conditions for an equilibrium system were well known, and the \({K_{\text{c}}}\) expression was almost universally correctly given, the incidence of curved brackets was very low. With the description of the effect of changing conditions, the increase in volume change generally scored, but the answers for the removal of ammonia were far too general to be given credit. It is pleasing to note that most candidates are aware of the importance of using the word &ldquo;'minimum&rdquo;, as well as the effect of a catalyst, with most giving perfect answers. The drawing of the Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution curve suffered from poor draughtsmanship. Too many curves did not start at the origin and lacked correct labels. An appreciable minority drew the energy/reaction co-ordinate graph. The knowledge of the compromise conditions for the Haber process was often confused, particularly with regard to why high pressure is not used, where far too many answers lacked the depth required. Occasionally the word &ldquo;pair&rdquo; was missing for the definition of a Lewis base, and with the definition of a weak Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry base most candidates failed to appreciate the difference between partially/slightly ionized and &ldquo;not completely&rdquo; ionized, the part of proton acceptor was also often missed out. With the description of the experiment to show the difference between a strong and weak base, many scored two out of the three available; the concept of a fair test, and the importance of equal concentrations was rarely appreciated.</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>This was by far the most popular question. As before the definition was poorly done and many students defined electronegativity as just attraction for electrons or energy change in gaining an electron. However, many could at least half explain why the atomic radius decreased. In (c) some students could write a correct equation for the addition of sodium oxide to water but very few could correctly write an equation for phosphorous(V) oxide with water, following on few could then correctly state a sensible pH for the solutions formed. Suggesting methods to distinguish between strong and weak acids was reasonably well answered but many student lost marks for the imprecision in their answers. Stating "see if it conducts" and "add pH paper" were common answers without predictions of the expected results. Identification of \({\text{B}}{{\text{F}}_{\text{3}}}\) as a Lewis acid was not always explained well as students mixed up proton donation and electron pair donation. In (f) the description of the bonding and structure of sodium chloride was not well done, although there were a few strong candidates who had little problems with this question. Most candidates could correctly state the ionic formulae though. The last part of this question asked for a Lewis structure of \({\text{PC}}{{\text{l}}_{\text{3}}}\) and most did this well, although some forgot the lone pairs on the chlorine atoms. Most could then correctly state a bond angle although there were a number of candidates who stated 120&deg;. Few candidates could explain why the molecule was polar.</p>

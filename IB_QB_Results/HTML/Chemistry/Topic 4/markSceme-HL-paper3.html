In the next few parts of the question many students lost marks by failing to answer fully, not referring to the <em>extensive </em>conjugation or the <em>large number </em>of <em>carbon-carbon </em>double bonds, as well as referring to temperature, rather than <em>increased </em>temperature, as a factor in the rate of oxidation. Lack of polarity was widely given as a reason for the fat solubility of carotenoids, though lack of groups able to form hydrogen bonds might have been more accurate (many quite polar molecules, such as \({\text{CHC}}{{\text{l}}_{\text{3}}}\), are insoluble in water).

<p class="p1">Q was only identified by the stronger candidates and even then few stated that waste needs oxygen to decompose. The ionic equation for the reaction of calcium ions with phosphate ions proved a real minefield. It was highly disappointing at HL that so many candidates did not know what the formula and charge of the phosphate anion actually is. Some gave phosphite and several gave phosphide. Core chemistry underpins all options and candidates need to be prepared to apply some basic chemical principles to the various topics in the options. This aspect will be further enhanced in the new chemistry syllabus, but performance of candidates in this particular question shows the importance of this even in the current syllabus. In (ii), candidates often used the ionic equation in (i) to write the solubility product expression and hence had an incorrect inverse equation. Many also did not realize that the activity of a species in the solid state is unity. In (iii), incorrect \({K_{{\text{sp}}}}\) expressions in (ii) threw some candidates and others could not deal with the math involved in the solution to the equation. Many thought the final answer was x and not 3x for \({\text{[C}}{{\text{a}}^{2 + }}{\text{]}}\). Of course the stronger candidates scored all three marks on this question. In (c), misreading of the question was common which specifically asked for a non-chemical reason for the decrease in oxygen concentration <em>i.e. </em>an increase in the temperature of the water.</p>

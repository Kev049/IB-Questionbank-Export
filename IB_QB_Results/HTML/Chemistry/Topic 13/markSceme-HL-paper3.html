<p class="p1">Surprisingly this was very poorly answered and few students scored all four marks here. There was often no clear understanding of the mechanism of colour absorption (and hence the observed colour being complementary &ndash; many candidates thought that the colour was caused by the subsequent emission of energy by electrons falling back). Some of the better candidates did refer to the fact that the ammonia ligand has a greater crystal field/ligand field splitting, which clearly showed comprehensive understanding of this subject.</p>

<p class="p1">(b) was very poorly answered and even the better candidates often scored zero marks here. In (i), it was very disappointing to see candidates failing to realise that in an octahedral crystal field the 3d sublevel splits into two sets of orbitals, a triply degenerate level which is lower in energy and a doubly degenerate level which is higher in energy. Many candidates put the triply degenerate level (the t<sub><span class="s1">2g </span></sub>level) at the same energy as the five-fold degenerate 3d sublevel, thereby clearly misunderstanding the splitting pattern. In addition, it was further very disappointing at HL to see candidates failing to apply Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity and placing two electrons in one orbital and one electron in another orbital. All three orbitals in the t<sub><span class="s1">2g </span></sub>level are degenerate and, hence, applying Hund‟s rule the electrons fill them singly first. Likewise in (ii), although some candidates stated that the splitting of the d-orbitals would increase if the ligand changed from water to ammonia, virtually no candidate mentioned a correct reason i.e. the fact that ammonia has greater charge density or is higher in the spectrochemical series. Clearly there were significant weaknesses in candidates‟ understanding of this topic overall.</p>

<p>Expect either the KOF or Kearney index to be selected. There are other possibilities, for example, Maastricht globalization index; CSGR (Warwick); Ernst &amp; Young.</p>
<p>Strengths include the multi-strand approach taken, recognizing that globalization comprises a range of processes that need to be measured, for example, KOF distinguishes between political, social and economic measures of globalization while Kearney uses four categories (economic, personal, technological or political integration).</p>
<p>Weaknesses can be conceptual (what is not included) or empirical (difficulties in collecting data and accuracy issues), for example, KOF&rsquo;s measures of social globalization are easily critiqued, such as the &ldquo;proximity&rdquo; of data.</p>
<p>For band C, one recognizable index of globalization should be described in a way that implies it has merit (has different strands) and may state one or two basic weaknesses.</p>
<p>To access band D, expect:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> more detailed knowledge of the chosen multi-strand index (with some attempt made to describe some weakness)</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> greater understanding of the weaknesses of economic and social data collection/comparisons in general (<em>eg</em> appreciates different perspectives on what is viewed as important; knows about flaws in survey methodology).</li>
</ul>
<p>At band E, expect both of these elements.</p>
<p>Other approaches may be equally valid. Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p><em>Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches wherever relevant.</em></p>
<p>Global interactions should be defined as a broad set of economic and sociocultural exchanges.</p>
<p>At the individual scale, a range of civil society initiatives can be discussed, such as Occupy/anti-globalization and, at the other end of the political spectrum, anti-immigration/nationalists <em>[Guide 7]</em>. However, some individuals continue to embrace the shrinking world <em>[Guide 2]</em> for a range of economic/cultural reasons <em>[Guide 5]</em>.</p>
<p>Evidence of resistance at the national level might include individual government attitudes towards the arrival of global media corporations <em>[Guide 5]</em> or towards immigration and diaspora growth <em>[Guide 5]</em> or towards MGO membership <em>[Guide 6]</em>. However, governments also recognize the advantages of globalization, free trade and financial flows <em>[Guide 5]</em>.</p>
<p>The concept of &ldquo;international organizations&rdquo; embraces MGOs <em>[Guide 6]</em> and international aid and development agencies responsible for financial flows, such as the politically-guided work of the IMF <em>[Guide 2]</em>. It is likely that candidates will choose to argue against the statement at this final scale.</p>
<p>Because the question specifies three scales of resistance, there are several routes to discussing the statement. One might be to offer some counterarguments (<em>eg</em> shows that some national governments embrace global interactions). Another might be to discuss the extent to which resistance is exhibited by individuals compared with governments and international organizations. Another might be to consider whether different kinds of interaction meet with varying strength or resistance (<em>eg</em> China embracing trade but resists information exchange). Each approach must be assessed on its own merits. However, a response that merely agrees with the statement cannot progress beyond the band C/D border.</p>
<p>For band C, resistance to global interactions must be identified at all three scales, with description provided of at least two.</p>
<p>To access band D, expect:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> broader knowledge of a range of reactions, at some different scales (thereby allowing the truth of the statement to be discussed, <em>eg</em> by comparing negative reactions at different scales; or by comparing positive and negative reactions at some of the specified scales <em>ie</em> individuals, governments and organizations)</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> some explicit discussion of the way that different types of global interaction may prompt different kinds of reaction at one/some of the specified scales.</li>
</ul>
<p>At band E, expect both of these elements.</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Candidates would be expected to define the term glocalization and good responses would benefit from using examples. Glocalization is a term that was invented in order to emphasize that the globalization of a product is more likely to succeed when the product or service is adapted specifically to each locality or culture in which it is marketed. The term combines the word globalization with localization.</p>
<p>The increasing presence of McDonald&rsquo;s restaurants worldwide is an example of globalization, while the restaurant chain&rsquo;s menu changes in an attempt to appeal to local palates are an example of glocalization. Perhaps even more illustrative of glocalization, for promotions in France, the restaurant chain replaced its familiar Ronald McDonald mascot with Asterix the Gaul, a popular French cartoon character. Similar adaptations are found with other products such as clothes and music.</p>
<p>To attain band D and above responses should clearly explain the term glocalization and are likely to include examples.</p>
<p>Other approaches may be equally valid and should be assessed on their merits.</p>
<p>Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Resistance to globalization is in response to real or perceived negative change that has occurred or may occur during the process. Answers are likely to examine a range of reasons, including cultural (cultural contrasts, disregard for a particular religion or customs, cultural imperialism), political (domination by other nations or TNCs), economic (domination, possibly including conditions imposed by international institutions such as the IMF, economic leakage from tourism) and environmental (damage from resource exploitation or transfer of polluting industries and waste).</p>
<p>Reaction to the impacts of TNCs may be a catalyst for resistance. Some parts of civil society (including NGOs) may initiate or strengthen resistance, especially in regard to a particular issue. The growth of ICT and the media now means that resistance can be further strengthened at rates that were previously impossible. For instance, the diffusion of anti-globalist sentiment can be carried out via texting or mobile devices, to coordinate protest activity.</p>
<p>Resistance may be spurred on by a resurgence of nationalism. Resistance may also arise in nations that choose to isolate themselves or limit their involvement in globalization.</p>

<p>Likely examples include the EU, NAFTA or the BRICS group (which has had annual meetings since 2009). Also credit other examples of global governance with a multi-governmental character, such as the IMF, World Bank, G8, OPEC, NATO, OECD. Also credit the UN, or UN-sponsored agencies. An analysis of the influence of a specific global conference or agreement/protocol (climate change meetings in Kyoto, Doha, <em>etc</em>) could reach band D/E provided that it is explicitly shown to be the product of multi-governmental collaboration, organization or debate (if not, limit such responses to band C).</p>
<p>Multi-governmental organizations (MGOs) influence the way citizens, civil society and businesses operate by relaxing barriers to certain types of global flow/movement (migrants, tourists, goods, capital, <em>etc</em>). A key issue is the diminishing effectiveness of political borders.</p>
<p>Alternative approaches might analyse the political influence that MGOs have over the governance of sovereign states:</p>
<ul>
<li>EU states must agree to adopt legislation from European Parliament (some may even know of the growing influence of Germany as a driver of EU policy affecting Greece during Eurozone crisis)</li>
<li>IMF insistence on economic reform/adjustments in countries seeking loans, sometimes critiqued as a neo-colonial form of influence</li>
<li>UN human rights rulings/war tribunals/peace-keeping operations</li>
<li>NATO or other military alliances and their actions</li>
<li>the macro-economic influence of OPEC during the 1970s (another approach might be to analyse why OPEC&rsquo;s influence has ceased to increase since)</li>
<li>the growing influence of the BRICS group (especially Chinese and Indian investment in African countries).</li>
</ul>
<p>At band D, expect <span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> description of some range of ways in which an MGO is influential, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> some chronology/explanation of why its influence is increasing.</p>
<p>For band E, expect both.</p>

</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p><em>Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches wherever relevant.</em></p>
<p>Three likely ways to discuss the statement (there may be others) are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>one way is to assess the net effect for a range of generic global concerns (&ldquo;every part of the world&rdquo; is thus interpreted as &ldquo;the world&rdquo;)</li>
<li>another way is to agree that there are few positives associated with global interactions, notably environmental effects, and to then address the extent to which particular places, especially isolated/wilderness regions <em>[Guide 7]</em>, have suffered</li>
<li>alternatively, candidates may offer a place-by-place or regional audit <em>eg</em> compares/discusses South America, Africa, USA, <em>etc.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Likely themes for discussion include:</p>
<ul>
<li>financial flows <em>[Guide 3]</em> and workplace exploitation, balanced against the alleviation of poverty</li>
<li>cultural interactions can bring homogeneity but also bring new forms of culture, and hybridity <em>[Guide 5]</em> but this must be balanced against the loss of authentic differences and the ways in which adopted cultural traits enable &ldquo;exploitative&rdquo; or consumerist TNCs to gain leverage to penetrate new markets, <em>etc</em></li>
<li>migration brings a range of effects for host and source regions <em>[Guide 5]</em>; these should be carefully weighed and, ideally, a genuine evaluation given (rather than listed costs and benefits)</li>
<li>environmental harm is likely to be a major theme <em>[Guide 4]</em>; some may argue that accelerated climate change stems from accelerated global interactions (accept this view), opening the way for a thoughtful discussion of predicted changes (including some beneficial ones, <em>eg</em> thermal growing season).</li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers may provide some discussion of the extent of these effects (the interrogation of whether &ldquo;every place&rdquo; is affected) and may focus on &ldquo;un-globalized&rdquo; societies <em>eg</em> Amazonian tribes <em>[Guide 7]</em>, ocean pathways for pollution and plastic-strewn coral atolls, Antarctic beaches, <em>etc.</em></p>
<p>At band D, there should be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> a detailed explanation of a variety of effects <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> a more critical discussion of the net balance/spread of effects.</p>
<p>For band E, expect both.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">b.</div>
</div>
<h2 style="margin-top: 1em">Examiners report</h2>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Some excellent answers were seen that addressed &ldquo;influence&rdquo; in multiple ways. Trade, geopolitics and migration were common themes that candidates using the EU or NAFTA explored. These were far and away the most popular examples, although a small minority wrote about Mercosur. Middle-ability candidates were sometimes shaky on important details, such as the number of EU member states.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Well-informed and well-revised candidates were likely to attain band D, as this was achievable by synthesizing a series of &ldquo;positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;negative&rdquo; case studies of almost any variety and concluding that global interactions have brought &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; results. Far fewer candidates displayed the ability to produce a nuanced evaluation of the statement that was more sensitive to the concepts of geographical place and scale. Where band E marks were awarded, candidates had generally progressed beyond a mere &ldquo;costs and benefits&rdquo; approach and were able to focus on the veracity of the statement that every part of the world is adversely affected by global interactions. They debated explicitly whether effects such as the spread of English language, or diffusion of plastic pollution in the oceans, are truly globalized phenomena or not.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em">Markscheme</h2>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>The different local societies may be in producer or consumer nations/areas. States can be treated as "local" places within a global context.</p>
<p>Examples of &ldquo;globalized production&rdquo; can be taken from any sector of industry: agribusiness, manufacturing or service sector (<em>eg</em> the outsourcing of call centres). The benefits for producer nations/areas could be economic (including multipliers, cheaper mass-produced goods, <em>etc</em>) and/or social (<em>eg</em> improved work opportunities for women, increased family wages and thus educational opportunities for children). Also credit the idea of increased consumer choice (<em>eg</em> fast food).</p>
<p>There are also benefits for local societies/regions that are now consumer/post-industrial regions, following global shift/relocation of polluting industries. It can be argued that they have &ldquo;re-invented&rdquo; themselves as cleaner, higher-wage societies that additionally benefit from cheap imports of global goods from producer regions.</p>
<p>Do not credit benefits for TNCs, or disadvantages for local societies, as neither is asked for by the question. Any such material should be deemed irrelevant.</p>
<p>For band C, two benefits of globalized production should be described in relation to local society/societies in general.</p>
<p>For band D, expect analysis of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> a wider range of benefits and/or recognizable local societies, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> a structured account that conceptualizes some different kinds of globalized production.</p>
<p>At band E, expect all of these elements.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p><em>Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches wherever relevant.</em></p>
<p>The focus should be whether environmental sustainability &ndash; the idea that future generations should enjoy the same landscapes, ecosystem services, resources, <em>etc</em> that are available for living generations &ndash; cannot be guaranteed if globalization continues along its current trajectory (with resulting environmental degradation).</p>
<p>Globalization is the growing economic interdependence of the world, accompanied by increased global flows of goods, people, capital, information. The &ldquo;growth&rdquo; of globalization is associated with high economic growth rates in emerging economies/NICs/BRICs and this may be commented on/highlighted as an area of particular environmental concern, along with the already large footprint of the USA and, to a lesser extent, Japan, Australia, NZ and EU nations. Some answers may lack focus on globalization/sustainability and instead describe how human activity in general results in problems such as acid rain, eutrophication and nuclear accidents (to name but a few). Such partial answers may still reach the band C/D border if they are sufficiently synthetic (see below).</p>
<p>Possible themes for synthesis linked to sustainability/globalization include:</p>
<ul>
<li>growth of core regions [<em>Guide 1</em>]</li>
<li>growth of transport networks for people and commodities [<em>Guide 2</em>]</li>
<li>ICT and information flows (may have lower footprint) [<em>Guide 3</em>]</li>
<li>agribusinesses, polluting industries and waste movements [<em>Guide 4</em>]</li>
<li>environmental awareness and green messaging [<em>Guide 4</em>]</li>
<li>food miles and air freight [<em>Guide 4</em>]</li>
<li>globalization of branded commodities (and implications for resource use and waste) [<em>Guide 5</em>]</li>
<li>de-industrialization and outsourcing [<em>Guide 2,3</em>]</li>
<li>some local sourcing movements are rooted in anti-globalization/sustainability rhetoric [<em>Guide 7</em>].</li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers scoring highly at AO3 may evaluate the extent to which some aspects of globalization are less harmful to the environment than others. Alternatively, a good inquiry of &ldquo;to what extent&rdquo; might take the view that growing global environmental awareness, or global cooperation on environmental issues and &ldquo;technical fixes&rdquo;, can ameliorate environmental degradation and may yet mean that long-term environmental sustainability is possible.</p>
<p>For band D there should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> be a structured synthesis of several well-evidenced themes taken from the subject guide, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> a properly evidenced conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) that considers the extent to which the statement is true.</p>

<p>A definition of cultural imperialism supported by further expansion is expected. One suitable definition would be: &ldquo;The promotion and imposition of the cultural traits of one nation upon another; a consequence of globalization&rdquo;. The supporting explanation should identify the following aspects of cultural imperialism, developing some of them further as shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultural imperialism involves cultural traits, their means of transfer, and their consequences.</li>
<li>Cultural traits include language, consumerism, customs, morals, art, architecture, religion and education.</li>
<li>The means of transfer include education, ICT, communications, the media, TNCs, trade and tourism.</li>
<li>The consequences may include dilution or loss of indigenous culture and the imposition of traits of the dominant culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best responses will incorporate examples, such as the &ldquo;Japanization&rdquo; of South Korea.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for responses to consider all aspects of cultural imperialism, provided that a range of traits and some mention of a variety of means of transfer is expressed.</p>

<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>It is expected that better responses will consider both positive and negative effects of global interactions.</p>
<p>Positive consequences of global interactions might include the introduction of improved technologies by some TNCs and the work of civil societies (including NGOs such as Greenpeace). International environmental agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, and the spread of knowledge and awareness of environmental issues through education might also be discussed.</p>
<p>Negative consequences include the degradation of landscapes and creation of homogenized landscapes due to agro-industrialization and globalization of cityscapes.</p>
<p>Some international interactions are reciprocal, in that benefits at the source may be counterbalanced by adverse consequences at the destination (movement of polluting industries; transfer of waste).</p>
<p>The best responses accessing bands E/F will discuss both urban and rural areas and a range of economic activities, such as the exploitation of natural resources, manufacturing and services including tourism. They may also discuss examples at a range of scales.</p>
<p>It is not essential for responses to treat positive and negative consequences of global interactions in equal depth. A good discussion of one may compensate for a weaker discussion of the other.</p>

<p>There are many possible approaches to answering this question.</p>
<p>The focus could be on:</p>
<ul>
<li>actual ICT network growth/adoption trends (in terms of numbers of subscribers/device owners/intensity of use/places where there is uptake)</li>
<li>growth of a single/narrower aspect of ICT adoption (<em>eg</em> mobile phone use, social networking, broadband provision)</li>
<li>the growing uses of ICT in civil society (more people exchanging ideas, information, finance) and/or changing rates of social adoption.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pathways for cultural diffusion include the movements of workers and tourists who carry cultural traits with them&nbsp;[Guide 5]. A wide variety of traits could be explored, such as language, religion, arts and music, cuisine, fashion etc. The movement of commodities and the diffusion of the internet and films, orchestrated by technology, TNCs and global media corporations respectively, are other key ways in which &ldquo;messages&rdquo; are transmitted [Guide 2]. Military and imperial ventures could also be discussed. A &ldquo;Trojan horse&rdquo; strategy of contemporary glocalization [Guide 7] could be explored &ndash; wherein western cultural icons (for example,&nbsp;denim, burgers etc.) gain access to foreign markets by donning &ldquo;cultural camouflage&rdquo;). MGO membership &ndash; notably the EU &ndash; also aids cultural transfers by easing restrictions on a variety of flows and pathways for cultural diffusion (such as greater freedom of movement for people or goods) [Guide 6].</p>
<p>The barriers may be physical, political, economic or cultural and they can include nationalism and anti-globalization movements and sentiments [Guide 6 and 7].

The best answers may look beyond a &ldquo;black and white&rdquo; world (where processes of exchange either do or do not operate) and might critically explore ways in which global cultural exchanges are negotiated locally, resulting in partial or selective transfers of culture that bring into being new hybridized cultural forms (language, art, music or cuisine often show a &ldquo;fusion&rdquo; of different influences).</p>

<p align="LEFT">Many candidates reached bands C and D of the markscheme by providing a range of valid examples of degradation linked to some degree with "large-scale" agriculture. Often, the explanations (for example, of eutrophication) were in-depth. However, a precise understanding of &ndash; or exemplification of &ndash; actual <em>agro-industrialization</em> was at times lacking. Thus, a very good answer might note that "cattle ranchers producing meat for McDonald's have to carry out their activities on an enormous scale to meet rising global demand. This is resulting in mass removal of forest both for ranching and for growing cattle food, for example, soya in Brazil". (Incidentally, blanket statements were sometimes made which were not necessarily accurate &ndash; for example, deforestation in Brazil is now less due to cattle ranching and more likely linked to Brazilian agriculture's turn towards soya production.)</p>

<p>Foreign direct investment (FDI) includes a range of different kinds of overseas&nbsp;investments made by transnational corporations (TNCs). These include: hiring&nbsp;outsourcing services (employing a third party to handle goods or services),&nbsp;establishing a &ldquo;spatial division of labour&rdquo; (building/buying company-owned branch&nbsp;plants or back offices in low-cost locations), mergers, acquisitions and franchises.&nbsp;Credit other possible<em> financial</em> outgoings (<em>eg</em> TNCs working alongside charities).&nbsp;Good answers should recognize more than one type of FDI, using examples.</p>
<p>Glocalization describes the adapting of a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; product to meet the cultural&nbsp;requirements of local markets (religion, taste, legal requirements may all vary from&nbsp;territory to territory). Glocalization is also linked to local sourcing strategies (using&nbsp;local suppliers), which may have political dimensions too (TNCs may be required to&nbsp;work with local partners <em>eg</em> in India).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Candidates could comment on how geographic expansion is achieved through use of&nbsp;these strategies. TNCs achieve greater profits/market share through their geographic&nbsp;strategies, and can win local acceptance by embracing local people&rsquo;s culture.</p>
<p>Candidates may additionally analyse how different strategies suit different TNCs (oil&nbsp;companies may not glocalize to the extent retailers do), or may analyse the&nbsp;weaknesses and not just the strengths of strategies.</p>

<p>Candidates will have studied global participation with reference to the Kearney or&nbsp;KOF globalization indices, which recognize economic, social and political strands of&nbsp;globalization. Therefore, accept a wide interpretation of what is meant by&nbsp;&ldquo;participation&rdquo; in globalization.</p>
<p>Possible themes suggesting a positive relationship between GNI and participation:</p>
<ul>
<li>well-known indexes (<em>eg</em>, KOF index) show high globalization scores for countries&nbsp;with a high GNI, as a rule <em>[Guide 1]</em></li>
<li>foreign direct investment by TNCs can bring many financial benefits that lead in&nbsp;turn to greater global economic participation for businesses and citizens&nbsp;(if incomes grow, allowing people to consume more globally-produced services or&nbsp;participate in tourism) <em>[Guide 3)</em></li>
<li>levels of sociocultural participation (an aspect of KOF) may also be higher for&nbsp;high-income countries <em>[Guide 5]</em></li>
<li>the role of remittances can be explored, as flows often take place between richer&nbsp;and poorer countries <em>[Guide 3]</em></li>
<li>poorer societies remain &ldquo;non-globalized&rdquo; <em>eg</em>, Amazonian tribes <em>[Guide 7]</em></li>
<li>poorer nations only experience one-way interactions &ndash; their assets are stripped by&nbsp;powerful nations/TNCs (raw materials, landgrabs) <em>[Guide 4]</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A more critical, thoughtful or nuanced response might take the view that:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are many types of global participation/interactions. People may participate&nbsp;in economic globalization but not necessarily cultural globalization (<em>eg</em>, Chinese&nbsp;factory workers with limited internet freedoms) <em>[Guide 1]</em></li>
<li>scale/disparities may be important. Some nations with higher GNI are&nbsp;&ldquo;two-speed&rdquo; societies: elite groups participate globally, not poorer groups<em>&nbsp;[Guide 1]</em></li>
<li>the relationship could be complex in the case of a migratory &ldquo;brain drain&rdquo; &ndash;&nbsp;remittances may boost GNI, but out-migration could reduce GNI too<em> [Guide 3]</em></li>
<li>the role of other aid/loans can be discussed &ndash; low GNI nations may be major&nbsp;beneficiaries of certain types of global financial flow<em> [Guide 3]</em></li>
<li>there are other possible exceptions/anomalies to the rule that can help lift a&nbsp;response into bands D/E.</li>
</ul>
<p>At band C, some links between GNI/wealth and globalization should be described.</p>
<p>Band D should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> provide a wider, detailed explanation of different links between&nbsp;GNI and participation <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> offer a more critical examination of what is meant by a&nbsp;country&rsquo;s &ldquo;participation in globalization&rdquo;.</p>

<p>While most candidates attempting this question were pleasingly familiar with glocalization, there was less familiarity with foreign direct investment (FDI). Some candidates explained why TNCs invest in foreign crime in order to reduce their costs (implying, perhaps, that such benefits might help a company&rsquo;s future expansion). Only a few were able to demonstrate much understanding of how FDI flows operate beyond "building a factory". The best answers looked at outsourcing, while a tiny minority were aware of the geographical importance of mergers and joint ventures. Although McDonald&rsquo;s is still the preferred case study of choice for candidates and teachers, most candidates remain in complete ignorance of how the company&rsquo;s presence in India is in the form of a joint venture. This goes a long way to explaining why it has been so successful at glocalizing its products in India, due to the expert local knowledge of its Indian partner companies.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>The command to &ldquo;examine the relationship&rdquo; (as opposed to &ldquo;explain the relationship&rdquo;) required candidates, ideally, to outline what underlying assumptions they would be making, preferably in their introduction. Weaker candidates generally established a simple positive correlation at the outset. Better answers suggested anomalies/outliers might need to be looked at too. At the very top end of the cohort, a small minority of candidates thought there could even be a reversal of the assumed relationship, whereby a wealthy country could maintain a degree of cultural isolation, whilst poorer countries sometimes become the global focus for international assistance and intervention, as in the case of Haiti. Sadly, most candidates did no more than assert that a strong positive relationship exists. To the credit of many, they performed a synthesis by suggesting that countries with a high GNI are likely to be home to many powerful TNCs, to be capable of cultural imperialism and to be highly attractive to economic migrants. Good answers sometimes made effective use of the KOF or Kearney index and demonstrated how some wealthy countries like the USA and UK score highly in all categories. However, it was a pity that more use was not made of interesting examples, such as China, which shows high participation in some ways but not in others.</p>

<p>There are many possible approaches. Responses may focus on examples of improved awareness in a single country or may consider the global realm of environmental management. Examples of the latter include response to transboundary pollution, such as oil spills or acid rain, and global climate change governance. They may also possess knowledge of global ecological/conservation initiatives such as Ramsar, WWF, and UNESCO.</p>
<p>The work of NGOs such as Greenpeace may also be explored. Candidates may examine the environmental messages that are sent as well as explaining the medium through which they are transmitted/type of global interaction (for example,&nbsp;internet, Facebook etc.).</p>
<p>Another approach is to argue that global interactions are often environmentally damaging and that we cannot help but be aware of them (for example,&nbsp;Gulf of Mexico oil spill or climate change).</p>
<p>Another response might look at how international movements of waste have improved environmental management for source countries who have simply paid to dispose of their problems elsewhere (for example,&nbsp;waste sent to China for recycling) and it may be noted that awareness of this trend is growing.</p>

<p>The nature of international interactions should be made explicit. Pathways for cultural exchanges include the movement of workers, tourists, commodity flows, and military and imperial ventures, all of which can be accelerated by membership of multi-governmental organizations, such as the EU, NAFTA, ASEAN etc. [Guide 6].</p>
<p>It is not true that homogenization is an inevitable outcome. Possible obstacles include nationalism and anti-globalization movements, as well as a range of local responses that challenge cultural imperialism or at least negotiate &ldquo;glocalized&rdquo; outcomes [Guide 7].</p>
<p>There is plenty of scope to discuss arts, music, cuisine and other fields of cultural expression, and to investigate hybridized outcomes &ndash; or to look at the obduracy of cultural traits among diaspora groups, meaning that cultural diversity is not lost in global hubs such as New York or Toronto [Guide 5].</p>
<p>In support of the statement, expect TNCs to feature, with some mention of &ldquo;McDonaldization&rdquo; or a similar argument using Starbucks, Disney etc. as examples, or broad observations about the spread of English and Spanish perhaps employing the concept of cultural imperialism. The strongest answers may critique the notion of glocalization, and question whether the innovation of a &ldquo;curry burger&rdquo; for the Indian McDonald&rsquo;s franchise is truly symptomatic of heterogeneity [Guide 3 and 5].</p>
<p>The role of technology and the internet in fostering homogeneity through the relation of the shrinking world/global village may also be a feature [Guide 2].</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p align="LEFT">One striking general weakness observed here was that many responses were insufficiently focused on how global interactions can foster environmental awareness. Answers could often explain "why" (for instance, it was widely argued that global awareness of climate change is inadvertently fostered by the careless polluting actions of TNCs that have come&nbsp;to the public's attention) but could not address "how" (that is,&nbsp;the processes or pathways&nbsp;that link global interactions to environmental awareness).</p>
<p>Good answers sometimes looked at use of global media (old and new) by NGOs; global diffusion of films such as "An Inconvenient Truth" (and the follow-up globetrotting of Al Gore, celebrities and academics, in order to help raise awareness of important issues); or the idea of representatives of nations "interacting" at key global environmental meetings and conferences such as Stockholm, Kyoto, Copenhagen etc. "Environmental awareness" was equated to "hazard awareness" by a few; there is some legitimate topic overlap, but they are really not equivalents and such responses tended to be self-limiting. Overall, there were some very strong answers to this question, the most popular of the three on the paper.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p align="LEFT">There were some strong answers to this question that used a commendable range of appropriate examples. In many cases, the net was thrown wide, allowing plenty of credit for assessment objective 3 to be awarded as candidates synthesized a mixture of ideas dealing with TNCs, diaspora groups, nationalism, global media and more.</p>
<p>Weaker answers showed little understanding of what "culture" does, or does not, include (and had little idea of cultural traits, for instance). They also tended to see changes of culture in a very simplistic way. For example, many argued that TNCs or other global interactions "destroy" local culture. Most interpreted any change at all as being towards homogenization, even when the influence of incoming cultural forces was limited and a more logical and appropriate conclusion might have been that local culture had undergone "diversification" (pleasingly, some employed terminology such as hybridity or glocalization here). Very few could tackle the more complex yet very useful idea (in this context) of culture as a "performance", for instance, in the context of querying the nature of the "loss" when a local tribe retains its traditional clothing or dances/rituals for the tourist gaze but may simultaneously (and more or less invisibly) be adopting a modern/secular/consumerist worldview. This is a complex idea requiring thoughtful evaluation that sadly eluded the majority (but is in fact very important if ideas of cultural change and exchange are to be properly explored). A sensible conclusion reached by some of the best candidates was that true global diversity (in terms of different languages) has fallen (though offset to some degree by proliferation of new hybrid glocalisms). Whereas at a local level, some global hubs/core regions/megacities have witnessed an increase in cultural diversity due to the global interaction of migration. Toronto and London are extremely diverse world cities (however, the "melting pot" hypothesis suggests this hyper-diversity may be transient &ndash; over time, differences may lessen at this scale also, as different cultures intermingle).</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Candidates would be expected to define &ldquo;global core areas/hubs&rdquo; as significant places that provide a focal point for global flows and activities. They are places where major diaspora groups may be found or may be identified as source regions either for contemporary cultural diffusion (for example,&nbsp;Seattle&rsquo;s computer industries) or economic imperialism (for example,&nbsp;Washington). The scale at which hubs can be identified is open to interpretation. Small cities like Cambridge (UK) are hubs, but so too are megacities such as Sao Paulo and small states including Monaco and Luxemburg.</p>
<p>Arguably, entire nations such as Singapore and South Korea could be described as hubs at which point the term hub is almost synonymous with &ldquo;core&rdquo; in world systems analysis. But an appropriate &ldquo;core and periphery&rdquo; analysis in 2011 should not simply echo 1970s World Systems theory. Responses that do not acknowledge this and do not examine more than a simple &ldquo;MEDC&ndash;LEDC&rdquo; worldview (for example,&nbsp;by at least acknowledging a semi-periphery of emerging economies/NICs) should not progress beyond band C. (Within bands D and E, a good explanation of a fuller range of characteristics could compensate for a more limited description of the hub/periphery pattern.)</p>
<p>At bands D and E, answers need to be focused on how such places can be <strong>distinguished</strong> from other places and should not just assert that they exist. People and organizations in hubs will display high levels of global participation which could be measured using KOF or AT Kearney indices. They may also host major diasporas or can be mapped as source regions for key &ldquo;globalized&rdquo; cultural traits including language (such as English or Spanish). Mapping the head offices of large TNCs is another route of inquiry. Other routes could include a ranking of the competitiveness of financial centres, airports, ports, internet bandwidth availability, reliance on agriculture.</p>
<p>Other approaches may be equally valid.</p>
<p>Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.</p>

<p><em>Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches wherever relevant.</em></p>
<p>Outsourcing should be clearly defined as the concept of taking internal company functions and paying an outside firm to handle them [Guide 3]. &ldquo;Geographical consequences&rdquo; of outsourcing can encompass economic, political, social, cultural, environmental, geopolitical and demographic themes at varying scales, for both host and source regions. Outsourcing occurs across all sectors of industry from agriculture to high-tech research. It can be a complex affair when strings of sub-contractors (both upstream and downstream linkages) are part of the picture.</p>
<p>Improvements in ICT are an important consequence (due to the need for enhanced videoconferencing capability etc.) and not merely a cause of outsourcing [Guide 2, Guide 3]. So too are trade blocs (MGOs), insofar as businesses will lobby for expanded tariff-free trade areas within which they may outsource at lower cost to themselves [Guide 6].</p>
<p>At a national and local (city region) scale, a key theme must be the reaction to loss of jobs in &ldquo;source&rdquo; economies [Guide 7], but growth for emerging &ldquo;host&rdquo; economies. Sweatshop workers may be cast as &ldquo;victims&rdquo; or beneficiaries of global capitalism in this account according to the case studies used (outsourcing includes &ldquo;white collar&rdquo; work in Bangalore, for instance) or the candidate&rsquo;s political convictions (although exploitation needs to be evidenced and not simply asserted). TNC shareholders may be recognized as being among the real winners of outsourcing [Guide 3].</p>
<p>Environmental aspects are likely to be a popular theme, notably in relation to pollution [Guide 4]. However, high band answers should make it clear that the problems result from outsourcing (so unreliable sub-contractors are the issue) and not simply the internationalization of trade.</p>
<p>It may not always be clear whether genuine outsourcing or a firm&rsquo;s own division of labour is being discussed (for example,&nbsp;as a cause of de-industrialization in developed countries). The benefit of the doubt should be given and a band D mark could be awarded to answers that are insecure on the precise meaning of outsourcing but are strong on the varied geography of global shift.</p>
<p>There are many possible approaches and these should be assessed on their merits. Depth might compensate for lack of breadth.</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p align="LEFT">This question produced a disappointing set of responses on the whole. Too many candidates merely asserted, wrongly, that a simplistic MEDC&ndash;LEDC divide still exists. There was next to no acknowledgment of globally important hubs such as Mumbai or Sao Paulo or other key settlements in emerging economies (or peripheral "LEDCs" as they were portrayed in most accounts, despite the BRIC group&rsquo;s key role in driving global GDP growth today). Overall, the cohort showed poor understanding of contemporary economic geography and the global pattern of hub regions.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The use of the word "hub" in the guide, and in this question, ought to be a clear signal to centres that the core&ndash;periphery literature dating from the 1970s is not, in itself, sufficient background reading for the current global interactions course. Candidates who relied exclusively on this outdated framework found themselves erroneously describing a global system within which a global periphery, that includes China and India, continues to provide raw materials for the manufacturing firms found in developed countries. Examiners were left wondering whether, in other contexts, such candidates would be able to explain the rise of the Asian tigers and BRIC economies, or the de-industrialization of the old global core.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Thus a widespread lack of familiarity with the concept of emerging economies as new global hubs (which must surely come from examining the latest KOF or Kearney indices) was seen. There was little mention of the activities of the world&rsquo;s financial hubs (which have triggered the global economic turndown that now surrounds us).</p>
<p align="LEFT">The concept of scale was clearly the biggest problem. There was a lack of comprehension that world cities in middle-income and low-income nations can nonetheless be global hubs. Effective teaching about globalization and global interactions needs to move beyond the nation state as the only frame of reference for patterns of wealth and connectivity.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p align="LEFT">Outsourcing is clearly defined in the guide. Many themes pertaining both to foreign direct investment and also outsourcing, such as financial flows, transboundary pollution and the factors encouraging the growth of multi-governmental organizations are scattered through the guide. Good candidates who were familiar with the synthetic nature of the part (b) essay mode of assessment rose to the occasion. The best answers came complete with plans that included positive and negative (or short-term and long-term) impacts, sub-divided into themed consequences such as economic [Guide 2/3]), environmental [Guide 4], political [Guide 6],&nbsp; and social [Guide 7].</p>
<p>Well-informed candidates were thus able to highlight how global networks of outsourcing have helped drive the trend towards regional trade bloc integration. Elsewhere, outsourcing was seen as a factor that can be responsible for poor health and safety standards (some asserted, perhaps correctly, that this was the cause of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill). Outsourcing of back office functions to India was a popular theme, whose consequences were seen as being both positive (rising incomes) and sometimes negative (long and unsociable hours for call centre workers).</p>
<p>Some discussed the social reaction/anti-globalization movements against outsourcing (linked with de-industrialization,&nbsp;for example,&nbsp;of US manufacturing hubs). A few even argued that outsourcing has introduced new kinds of geographical risks for TNCs who find their supply chains disrupted by recent hazards such as Thai floods, Japan&rsquo;s tsunami and Icelandic ash clouds. This is a truly synthetic theme and one that future candidates could be encouraged to explore further.</p>
<p>In contrast, weaker candidates were uncertain as to the exact nature of outsourcing and were clearly not able to differentiate between outsourcing and FDI (for instance, when discussing the relocation of US manufacturing to the Mexican <em>maquiladoras</em>). If a good range of consequences were developed, however, such candidates were still allowed to achieve a sound mark.</p>

<p>Consumer culture may be described and exemplified as the spread of purchasing habits&nbsp;(branded clothes, fast food, music), or analysed in greater depth as the spread of a capitalist&nbsp;worldview wherein everyday life is commoditized and branded. Multiple traits of consumer&nbsp;culture might be identified, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>changing tastes in food (linked with retail and restaurant TNCs)</li>
<li>fashion (linked with global media corporations)</li>
<li>music purchasing (linked with online platforms such as iTunes and YouTube).</li>
</ul>
<p>The key factors that can be explained include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the expansion of TNCs in a drive for new markets (may involve glocalization)</li>
<li>the growth of global media and ICT (operating either as an independent factor or as a byproduct&nbsp;of innovation by TNCs such as <em>Microsoft</em> and <em>Apple</em>)</li>
<li>the concept of cultural imperialism (linked either to the activities of TNCs or superpower&nbsp;states with &ldquo;soft power&rdquo; such as the USA).</li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers may note that the factors are interrelated and reinforce one another (TNCs&nbsp;drive innovation, for instance). Another approach might examine how different factors&nbsp;might be linked with different aspects/traits of consumer culture (the spread of designer&nbsp;clothes can be related to container shipping and TNCs; the purchasing of online games and&nbsp;music can be related to ICT).</p>
<p>For band C, expect two factors to be described and linked with the spread of culture and/or&nbsp;commodities.</p>
<p>At band D, expect <span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> more detailed explanation of a range of factors linked with the&nbsp;spread of culture/commodities <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> greater explanation of what is meant by &ldquo;the spread of&nbsp;consumer culture&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Management by national government may comprise migration controls, rules for FDI, terms&nbsp;attached to loans and aid, the issues of internet control and censorship. Successes and failure&nbsp;to control may be highlighted either between different countries, or different kinds of global&nbsp;interaction (trade/migration/information flows), or both.</p>
<p>Possible themes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>MGOs such as the EU and NAFTA as evidence the statement is correct and countries&nbsp;must now group together in order to try to manage global interactions in ways that reestablish&nbsp;some control <em>[Guide 6]</em></li>
<li>cultural globalization as an unstoppable force (or not) and national attempts to control&nbsp;flows of media and information <em>[Guide 5]</em></li>
<li>the power of global financial institutions <em>eg</em> IMF and its insistence that national&nbsp;governments institute reforms <em>eg</em> SAPs<em> [Guide 3]</em></li>
<li>migration issues and controls<em> [Guide 3, 6, 7]</em></li>
<li>government promotion of localism <em>[Guide 7]</em></li>
<li>transboundary pollution <em>[Guide 4]</em></li>
<li>government attitudes towards foreign direct investment and financial flows&nbsp;<em>[Guide 2]</em></li>
<li>military conflicts <em>eg</em> ISIS in the Middle East <em>[current affairs].</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers may be structured around different kinds of global interactions (<em>eg</em> contrasts&nbsp;management of economic interactions and cultural globalization in the course of the essay).&nbsp;Another approach might be to discuss the effectiveness of the actions of different types of&nbsp;government (democracies and autocracies).</p>
<p>For band D, expect a structured discussion of how national governments control/cannot&nbsp;control different kinds of global interaction.

<p>The best answers explained what was meant by consumer culture, as opposed to &ldquo;culture&rdquo; in general. Candidates were often well-versed in geographical terminology and could write with confidence about cultural diffusion and imperialism. In contrast, some candidates produced a &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; response that a candidate of any subject might have written. These answers focused on the power of advertising and branding, often at great length. Sometimes, this was sufficient for band C or even D.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>This popular question allowed a wide range of themes to be synthesized. The change in the power of national governments was often thoroughly interrogated by the strongest candidates. At the upper end, there was frank acknowledgment that opting out of economic globalization is not a realistic strategy for any leading industrialized nation, but that degrees of control over migration and information flows are still achievable.</p>

<p>Outsourcing is when a company hands internal functions to an outside company&nbsp;(a client relationship), for example US/EU clothing companies outsource to Bangladesh; ICT&nbsp;outsourcing to Bangalore/Philippines;<em> BP</em> outsourcing of Gulf of Mexico oil rig operation to&nbsp;Halliburton; <em>McDonald&rsquo;s</em> outsourcing the management of its restaurants to local companies in&nbsp;some states.</p>
<p>Outsourcing overlaps with foreign direct investment to a large extent if the TNC invests or has&nbsp;an ownership stake in the company it outsources to. There is considerable overlap between&nbsp;outsourcing and other forms of FDI (&ldquo;offshore&rdquo; branch plant construction) in terms of the&nbsp;important factors that drive these practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>cheap labour (and other low costs <em>eg</em> health and safety)</li>
<li>low taxes (including use of Export Processing Zones/SEZs)</li>
<li>local supplier&rsquo;s ability to source cheap parts/materials or greater familiarity with market&nbsp;(glocalization).</li>
</ul>
<p>These generic factors should be credited, even if the candidate&rsquo;s link to proper outsourcing (as&nbsp;opposed to other forms of FDI) is insecure.</p>
<p>Good answers may show awareness that some companies may prefer to keep their operations in-house&nbsp;or may only outsource non-essential operations, or are beginning to &ldquo;re-shore&rdquo; operations&nbsp;to reduce supply chain risks (Japanese tsunami, disturbances in Ukraine, Nigeria, Kenya, <em>etc</em>).&nbsp;Another approach might be to analyse how some types/sectors of TNCs (mining operations, agribusinesses) may be less reliant on outsourcing than manufacturers and retailers with large&nbsp;and complex supply chains. Another approach might be to analyse how some TNCs, such as&nbsp;<em>Amazon</em> and <em>Starbucks</em>, have been criticized by the governments of sovereign states for the&nbsp;claim that they have &ldquo;outsourced&rdquo; operations to different subsidiaries of their own company (in&nbsp;an attempt to avoid corporation tax).</p>
<p>For band C, expect some description of the reasons why it is important for TNCs to have&nbsp;different operations/activities carried out in different places.</p>
<p>At band D, expect <span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> more detailed explanation of why different operations/activities are&nbsp;carried out in different places <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> a good attempt to analyse why outsourcing is important for different TNCs.</p>

<p>The focus might be how a range of reasons/factors, including migration, helps explain the&nbsp;loss (or not) of distinctive local cultures. Likely reasons include internet/media, tourism,&nbsp;rising wages in emerging economies and elsewhere/changing employment structures.&nbsp;Credit physical reasons too, such as suggested climate change refugees (Tuvalu, Maldives).</p>
<p>Alternatively, candidates might discuss the extent to which migration brings loss/harm or&nbsp;benefits to the world&rsquo;s many local cultures in both source and host regions for migration. Rather than addressing other factors, the discussion can encompass a range of ways in which migration and diaspora growth impacts on local cultures, including their preservation (the cultural &ldquo;fossilization&rdquo; of diaspora source nations, for instance).</p>
<p>Possible themes relating to migration and/or local culture include:</p>
<ul>
<li>migration, diaspora and multiculturalism <em>[Guide 5]</em></li>
<li>homogenous urban landscapes<em> [Guide 4]</em></li>
<li>tourism and the tourist gaze<em> [Guide 5]</em></li>
<li>cultural imperialism<em> [Guide 5]</em></li>
<li>global media and TNCs as agents of change <em>[Guide 5 and 7]</em></li>
<li>nationalist movements <em>[Guide 6]</em></li>
<li>isolationism<em> [Guide 7].</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers may discuss what is meant by &ldquo;loss&rdquo;: culture comprises many traits, some of&nbsp;which may persist while others are lost or change. Another approach might be to discuss the&nbsp;emergence of new hybrid or &ldquo;melting point&rdquo; cultures <em>eg</em> in World Cities: these may replace&nbsp;previously homogenous cultures but they can be just as distinctive as the more homogenous<br>cultures that were found there before.</p>
<p>For band D, expect a structured discussion, the central elements of which are migration, local&nbsp;cultures and possibly some additional reasons/factors.

<p>Outsourcing is a term that still causes confusion and was poorly understood by a surprising number of candidates. Typically, they used vague language, such as: &ldquo;outsourcing is when a country uses the work force in another country&rdquo;. Outsourcing is defined by the geography guide as &ldquo;The concept of taking internal company functions and paying an outside firm to handle them. Outsourcing is done to save money, improve quality or free company resources for other activities.&rdquo; Within the context of a&nbsp;geography examination paper (as opposed to business management), it may safely be assumed that a company which outsources its operations overseas becomes, by default, what we would term a TNC. The geography guide defines a TNC as &ldquo;a firm that owns or controls productive operations in more than one country through foreign direct investment&rdquo;. Significant global outsourcing relationships create a partnership (or global interaction) wherein both companies play a role in productive control. The client company may pay for training, or invest in the transfer of technology to the supplier company. The exam question also asked candidates to address the &ldquo;importance&rdquo; of the relationship for the Client Company, or TNC. Profitability was a key theme to explore here, linked with various low-cost factors of production. Well-developed examples were frequently supplied, usually Bangalore (call centres) or China (manufacturing). A few mentioned Bangladesh. Some of the best answers analysed the declining of outsourcing as a result of recent &ldquo;reshoring&rdquo; by risk-averse companies. Weaker candidates sometimes drifted off course and provided a lengthy cost-benefit analysis of outsourcing for India, rather than writing about the importance of outsourcing for companies.</p>

<p>The best answers were carefully structured around a range of possible factors, not just international migration, and used strong supporting evidence. Some of the strongest candidates offered a final substantiated judgment of whether migration is, or is not, the dominant factor. A minority of candidates misunderstood where the emphasis of the essay statement lies. They discussed whether migration was responsible for a loss, or gain, of culture. This approach was often hard to carry through and many floundered when it came to arguing coherently whether the presence of a diaspora community in a world city represents a loss, or gain, of &ldquo;distinctive local cultures&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Polluting industries include manufacturing or mining operations with a large footprint and a polluting or dangerous character in the absence of regulation (examples might include Apple&rsquo;s contractors in China). There are also international movements of waste (for recycling or disposal), for example, UK wastes to China (recycling) and European waste taken by contractors to Ivory Coast (dumping). The oil industry has brought polluting operations to many territories. While this is not strictly a &ldquo;relocation&rdquo;, the benefit of the doubt should be given to accounts of the expansion/diffusion of polluting industries (<em>ie</em> consequences of oil pollution in new deep water sites, for example, Gulf of Mexico, new sites in Niger delta, should be credited). Also credit eutrophication linked to agro-industry/agribusiness, <em>etc</em>.</p>
<p>The causes might include a quest for cheap sites (thus higher profits) and expect explanations to include details of labour costs, lack of red tape, <em>etc</em>. Weaker answers are likely to neglect causes, or provide simple assertions only (<em>eg</em> &ldquo;there&rsquo;s too much waste nowadays&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Consequences for both physical environments (landscape, ecosystems) and people should be addressed. Some may be positive (<em>eg</em> recycling waste as a resource; FDI and its multiplier effects). Long-term litigation and quest for justice could even be a theme that is explored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shrinking world&rdquo; (time-space compression) should be explained and related to different ICT and transport technologies <em>[Guide 2]</em>. Increased migration can be credited as a symptom of a shrinking world (because migrants make use of transport). Trade blocs/MGOs, <em>eg</em> EU, can play a supporting role (because the removal of border controls removes intervening obstacles to migration/transport).</p>
<p>Possible economic benefits derived from connectivity include: more profitable TNCs, with work opportunities for outsourcing locations and locations in receipt of FDI <em>[Guide 3]</em> especially when long view is taken (<em>eg</em> signs of factory reform in Bangladesh). A range of sociocultural benefits can be explored that relate to the sharing of global media, the growth of social networks, <em>etc [Guide 5]</em>. The ease with which migrant remittances can be wired home (or money transferred via mobiles) might be explored <em>[Guide 5]</em>. There are many other benefits that can be mentioned, for example, access to branded commodities <em>[Guide 5]</em>.</p>
<p>There are, of course, cases where the statement may not be true and societies remain non-globalized/disconnected. Expect examples of indigenous people, isolated tribes, or variation within societies, for example, subsistence farmers <em>[Guide 7]</em>.</p>
<p>Another counterargument would be the &ldquo;one-sided&rdquo; benefits of connectivity, wherein poorer connected places are exploited as low-wage production sites, possibly suffering environmental problems <em>[Guide 4]</em>; the sociocultural reaction against globalization, and movements aiming to limit shrinking world effects in some way, for example, increased food localism or the resurgence of nationalism <em>[Guide 6, 7]</em>. Indigenous people may be victims, not beneficiaries, of global interactions <em>[Guide 5]</em>. A current affairs focus might be on internet privacy/rights.</p>
<p>For band C, the shrinking world/globalization (may not distinguish) must be described and its benefits commented on.</p>

<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> both sides of the argument are addressed (some societies/places benefit, some do not not), displaying some synthesis of a range of ideas, mostly (but not always) linked to the idea of a shrinking world/technology and transport</li>

<p>Global interactions may be defined as a diverse set of flows (economic, social, cultural, <em>etc</em>), potentially &ldquo;setting the scene&rdquo; for an essay which provides a nuanced conclusion that discusses the extent to which the statement is true for different types of global interaction.</p>
<p>Likely themes and barriers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>free trade versus protectionism (and the role trade blocs play); the focus will be loss of sovereignty and multi-governmental organizations (MGOs) <em>[Guide 6]</em></li>
<li>information exchange versus censorship, linked to growing importance of technology/&ldquo;shrinking world&rdquo; theory <em>[Guide 2]</em></li>
<li>&ldquo;open-door&rdquo; migration versus points systems and restrictions either in the context of economic migration or diaspora studies <em>[Guide 3, Guide 5]</em></li>
<li>some possible considerations of the now well-documented and growing risks associated with outsourcing/offshoring<em> [Guide 3]</em> &ndash; perhaps an &ldquo;end of globalization&rdquo; argument</li>
<li>physical/environmental barriers may not be growing but are certainly falling due to overcoming of friction of distance <em>[Guide 2]</em></li>
<li>developed further, the migration and offshoring debates can be linked with the resurgence of nationalism and anti-globalization movements <em>[Guide 6, Guide 7]</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The double-edged effect of MGOs may be remarked on &ndash; namely, that they reduce barriers to internal exchanges while erecting barriers to external trade (<em>eg</em> through the adoption of a common external tariff in the case of the EU, thereby excluding some producers from access to European markets).</p>
<p>Good answers may conclude that the response to the question depends on the type of interaction that is being discussed (thus China is more open to flows of FDI than in the past, pre-1978; yet efforts to censor the internet have increased in line with its growing popularity). Some countries encourage economic interactions but attempt to curtail cultural ones.</p>
<p>At band D, expect <span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> a detailed explanation of a variety of ways in which barriers are changing, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> a more critical discussion of different kinds of barriers and interactions.</p>

<p>Many mediocre responses were seen. Some very generalized impacts were described, with many candidates offering little beyond &ldquo;pollution&rdquo; or &ldquo;global warming&rdquo;. Also, the phrase &ldquo;rising global demand&rdquo; was glossed over in most cases, with candidates simply asserting that more oil or timber (the most popular choices) is needed today than in the past. Few could link the rising demand with important global development such as the rise of consumption in emerging economies. Higher level diploma geography candidates really ought to be in possession of supporting data in relation to the changing global pattern of wealth. One good starting point for updating content, already mentioned in a previous subject report for this paper, is this recent McKinsey report:</p>

<p>Transboundary pollution (TBP) is pollution that crosses a national border accidently or&nbsp;inadvertently due to physical processes (atmosphere, currents, <em>etc</em>). Recent examples of&nbsp;transboundary pollution (TBP) include forest fires in Indonesia causing smog in Singapore;&nbsp;Chinese pollution reaching Japan; and radiation from Fukushima reaching the shores of the&nbsp;USA. Also credit acid rain (if clearly shown to be transboundary) and credit Chernobyl&nbsp;(1986). [The Gulf of Mexico oil spill was not a TBP event because only the USA was&nbsp;affected. Candidates using this example only may still attain band D according to other&nbsp;criteria, but ought not be awarded band E.]</p>
<p>Transnational waste movement (TWM) includes landfill in China originating in USA;&nbsp;European e-waste arriving in Accra (Ghana); ship-breaking in Bangladesh; <em>Trafigura&rsquo;s&nbsp;</em>chemical waste from Europe arriving in Ivory Coast. This is a purposeful/intended global&nbsp;interaction/trade transaction. It is acceptable to view discarded household goods (<em>eg</em> clothes&nbsp;for charity) as a form of waste. Waste can also be a very valuable resource when recycled,&nbsp;so TWM can be seen as a positive interaction.&nbsp;Good answers are likely to provide detailed exemplification. They are also likely to make a&nbsp;better effort to distinguish (beyond simply employing comparative language such as &ldquo;whereas&rdquo;): <em>eg</em> TBP may involve the dispersal of point source pollution into multiple&nbsp;territories whereas TWM is a movement from one territory to another; TBP has negative&nbsp;impacts/costs money but TWM can also be positive/makes money; TBP is accidental but&nbsp;TWM is deliberate, <em>etc</em>).</p>

<p>The global periphery may be defined as regions outside/beyond the core. Historically, some&nbsp;states were identified as being peripheral due to their spatial distance/isolation or lack of&nbsp;integration into economic and political systems. In 2015, this idea of peripheral states is&nbsp;only a very basic/antiquated starting point. A contemporary account might acknowledge&nbsp;also the existence of semi-peripheral states (middle-income countries) or the presence of&nbsp;important global hubs/cores such as Lagos in states that some people might still view as&nbsp;being part of a global periphery.</p>
<p>Another approach might be to discuss the extent to which various global flows and&nbsp;interactions (from international aid to social networks) have networked/connected the&nbsp;majority of the world&rsquo;s states and a large proportion of their peoples. To give a counterargument,&nbsp;examples might be cited of isolated states and regions, from which we can infer&nbsp;the existence of a &ldquo;global periphery&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Possible themes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>economic globalization of low-income countries through trade, aid, loans<em>&nbsp;[Guide 3]</em> that may originate in EU/USA &ldquo;core&rdquo; countries but also emerging&nbsp;economies/BRICs/NICs <em>[Guide 1 and 3]</em></li>
<li>cultural interactions between countries in the core and periphery <em>[Guide 5]</em></li>
<li>isolated states <em>eg</em> North Korea, China (culturally); non-globalized tribal groups <em>[Guide 6&nbsp;and 7]</em></li>
<li>the &ldquo;shrinking world&rdquo; effect that brings connectivity to previously peripheral places&nbsp;<em>[Guide 3]</em></li>
<li>branded commodities and global media that help to connect places through the growth of&nbsp;a common &ldquo;core&rdquo; culture (possibly modified by glocalization) which more and more&nbsp;places share <em>[Guide 5]</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers may discuss differing degrees of &ldquo;peripheral&rdquo; states (perhaps including semiperiphery,&nbsp;non-globalized periphery). Another approach might be to discuss the multi-scale&nbsp;existence of core and periphery patterns (recognizing the global importance of world cities in&nbsp;Asia, Africa and Latin America). Another approach might be to discuss what is meant by&nbsp;&ldquo;global interactions&rdquo; in the context of this question (referring to a variety of trade flows, aid&nbsp;flows, migration flows, information flows, <em>etc</em>).</p>
<p>For band D, expect a structured discussion of how global interactions have contributed to the disappearance/persistence/modification of a &ldquo;global periphery&rdquo; of places/people. This&nbsp;should include <span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> a synthesis of several well evidenced themes taken from the subject&nbsp;guide, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> nuanced and evidenced conclusion/evaluation of the statement.</p>

<p>Most candidates understood clearly the difference between transboundary pollution and transnational waste movement. Relevant examples were used, although the detail and accuracy was variable. Very few used Fukushima as a case study, preferring to use the 30-year-old Chernobyl example instead. This is a pity and clearly goes against the ethos of the course which is stated on page 13 of the geography guide.

<p>A handful of excellent answers showed deep understanding of how global interactions have modified the previously binary world system (the &ldquo;north/south&rdquo; or &ldquo;core/periphery&rdquo; of the immediate post-war period). They wrote about the evolution of a far more complex world, beginning with the rise of the Asian Tigers in the 1950s. Other strong answers dealt with the statement on a flow-by-flow basis and understood that a country like China could be regarded as being part of an economic core but had chosen to remain peripheral to social networks such as Facebook. Weaker answers tended to focus mainly on isolated tribes and the Sahel as non-globalized places. Done well, however, band D was still achievable through the use of this narrow approach.</p>

<p>A transboundary pollution event is one which has damaging effects for more than one country. It is most likely that candidates will analyse a major oil spill or air pollution event. &ldquo;Event&rdquo; strongly suggests a single dated occurrence but some credit should still be given to an account of a more pervasive problem (such as acid rain). Thus, for band E, the account must clearly relate to transboundary pollution (thus the pollution type is named,&nbsp;for example, sulphur dioxide or crude oil; affected states are clearly identified). Further, the temporal aspect should be addressed: if not a single event (for example,&nbsp;an oil spill) then a period (year or decade) must be identified (giving us a broad interpretation of &ldquo;event&rdquo;). An account of acid rain that is not geographically or historically specific should not move beyond band C. If both are there, band E is possible.</p>
<p>It should be made explicit who is affected and why the event is &ldquo;transboundary&rdquo;. The consequences may include: immediate ecological and environmental harm; longer clear-up operations; subsequent changes in national and/or international legislature; implications for the polluter (such as poor publicity and &ldquo;PR nightmare&rdquo; for TNCs).</p>
<p>The best answers may have a range of varied consequences (such as political/governance response) and will not simply focus on ecological damage.</p>
<p>Pollution events such as the Bhopal incident are not transboundary but may achieve band C if the concept of transnational has been well explored (idea of TNCs moving their pollution/unsafe operations overseas).

<p>The negative effects candidates should be familiar with include the threat of cultural homogenization associated with the diffusion of western, and latterly Japanese, cultural traits and branded commodities. In extreme cases this can be described as cultural imperialism [Guide 5]. The cultural production of homogenized landscapes may be commented on [Guide 4].</p>
<p>The question invites discussion of whether this first viewpoint has been overstated. The strongest responses will recognize alternative responses exist and globalization can be challenged/contested. They may suggest a variety of alternative outcomes,&nbsp;for example,&nbsp;hybridization/glocalization of branded products [Guide 7], or growth of diaspora music and art that draws on global influences [Guide 5]. More extreme forms of rejection also exist, such as throwing out TNCs and the IMF [Guide 3] or the resistance of nationalist parties to MGO membership [Guide 6]. At a local level, people may &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; and pursue strategies such as local sourcing of food (food preferences being a cultural trait) [Guide 7].</p>
<p>The persistence of diaspora traits is also clear evidence of cultural resilience (that is,&nbsp;the idea that cultural traits can easily survive) [Guide 5]. Equally, it may be argued that some cultures have remained free of global influences by choice,&nbsp;for example,&nbsp;Bhutan [Guide 7].</p>
<p>The process of cultural homogenization &ndash; if it exists &ndash; can be very complex and alternative viewpoints should be credited on their merits.</p>
<p>At bands D and E, both sides of the argument should be addressed, although balance need not be expected if the candidate has a strong, <strong>evidenced</strong> argument that mostly agrees or disagrees with the title.</p>
<p>A wide variety of cultural traits can be accepted, including any that are not specifically mentioned in the syllabus. Answers that rely heavily on just one or two case studies (especially if their relevance to contemporary globalization is spurious, such as early encounters between westerners and the Dani tribe) are likely to be too narrow to receive much credit for assessment objective 3&nbsp;and are unlikely to progress beyond band C.</p>

<p align="LEFT">A checklist for an appropriate example of a transboundary pollution event has three boxes to tick. Candidates should ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it an example of human-induced pollution, such as sulphur emissions?</li>
<li>Is the example transboundary? (While many used the recent BP Gulf of Mexico oil spill, few were able to describe any legitimate transboundary effects.)</li>
<li>Can they describe their case study as an "event" &ndash; something of a clearly stated duration? (This might be a single event such as a nuclear accident, but could be a longer-duration event such as Kuwaiti oil fires, or even acid rain during the1970s or possibly ozone depletion in the early 1980s, whereas "global warming" since 1750 is hard to justify as an "event".)</li>
</ul>
<p>The examples that worked best were Chernobyl (although this is a slightly antiquated example, its effects are still felt today) and the far more recent Japanese tsunami (which quickly became a transboundary event, with nuclear radiation detected on the US Pacific coast within two weeks of the explosion).</p>
<p>A few more sketch maps would have been useful here, as some case studies were poorly located and the spatial extent of the pollution weakly understood. Among weaker candidates, the interpretation of "consequences" tended to be quite limited and almost entirely short-term and overwhelmingly negative, even for events that actually led to substantial improvements in practice, regulations and legislation.</p>

<p align="LEFT">The provocative statement forced weaker candidates to attempt some sort of evaluation and to therefore present conflicting evidence, which was pleasing to see. The most popular themes were the modernization of indigenous peoples and the glocalization concept. Urban landscapes were sometimes included too. A few tackled diaspora but not many. Given that this is a geography exam, there was a disappointing lack of attention to scale. What is happening at a planetary level (loss of languages etc.) is very different from what happens at a local scale in world cities/global hubs, where diversity has never been greater or richer in many cases.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Overly historical accounts should be discouraged as the focus is meant to be contemporary globalization (which is widely accepted as either a post-war or even post-1980s phenomenon). The best responses were synthetic and covered five or six themes; in contrast, many weaker answers devoted two pages to the trials and tribulations of the Dani tribe and one page to the contents of McDonald&rsquo;s menus, resulting in a mediocre performance overall.</p>

<p><em>There is no universal agreement on the precise meaning of these terms, but expect a general distinction to be made between voluntary/consented changes (diffusion) and enforced/pressured changes (imperialism). In reality, there is a spectrum of pressure, and candidates may take different positions on this. All arguments should be judged on their individual merits.</em></p>
<p>Cultural imperialism denotes the projection of power &ndash; wherein a subaltern community or subordinate country experiences the &ldquo;top-down&rdquo;/forced imposition of cultural traits <em>eg </em>religion (missionaries), language, legal structures, dress codes, <em>etc.</em> Examples might include English language insistence in some Alaskan Inuit schools in recent times; or China in Tibet today; Indonesia and East Timor. Global domination of English &ndash; via the internet &ndash; is another contemporary theme, or American cultural hegemony (Hollywood, <em>etc</em>).</p>
<p>Cultural diffusion denotes a wider set of processes of cultural spread of which imperialism is just one avenue. Traits may be sought out and adopted voluntarily(<em>eg </em>Japanese teenagers adopting US music, film, <em>etc</em>). There are many avenues for diffusion, notably migration and music (via the internet). Adoption of Mexican diaspora cultural traits (especially food) by wider US society might be explored (or parallel examples elsewhere, <em>eg </em>UK, Sweden).</p>
<p>Political viewpoints may differ as to how the actions of TNCs should be categorized (the spread of consumerism may be seen either as a form of imperialism, or as diffusion) and different arguments should be judged on their own merits and in light of the evidence presented.</p>
<p>Good answers may touch on the growing projection of <em>eg </em>Indian and Chinese culture as exemplification, rather than being restricted entirely to historical European and USA superpower examples.</p>
<p>To access band C, both concepts/processes must be addressed and examples provided; and at band D, an attempt at distinguishing should be made, with specific examples of both provided (though the distinction may not be entirely convincing, because the concepts are sophisticated ones).</p>
<p>To access band E, the response should be well-balanced, well-articulated and well-exemplified.</p>
<p>Other approaches may be equally valid. Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.</p>

<p>Loss of sovereignty describes a state surrendering legislative power (<em>eg </em>can no longer act unilaterally when setting tariffs, migration controls <em>etc</em>). Loss of sovereignty could also be seen as a growing dependency on foreign-based TNCs, and foreign influences on national culture, <em>etc</em>. Some may argue the retreat of national identity, due to cultural diffusion <em>[Guide 5] </em>is progressive (&ldquo;global citizen&rdquo; ideas).</p>
<p>Reasons for loss of actual political sovereignty could include the growth of multi-governmental organizations (MGOs) or trade blocs, the actions of global organizations such as World Bank and IMF, the growth of international treaties and courts, as well as the excessive power of large global corporations <em>[Guide 6]</em>. Do not expect all of these themes to be covered, even in a good answer.</p>
<p>The economic logic behind MGOs may be appreciated and the benefits this can have for freer financial flows and migration flows, which may bring wealth to host and source regions <em>[Guide 3]</em>. Thus, some groups/companies/governments respond to globalization by embracing the benefits associated with MGO membership (weaker answers may simply cite the benefits, rather than explaining why some businesses show enthusiasm for MGO membership).</p>
<p>The negative response against globalization &ndash; such as resurgence of nationalism and opposition to migration in the EU &ndash; are likely themes <em>[Guide 6] </em>that can be extended through the analysis of the reaction of civil society and the organized rejection of this aspect of globalization, perhaps through political or religious pressure groups.</p>
<p>There is also the larger-scale idea of countries &ldquo;opting out&rdquo; of globalization (N Korea, Bhutan) <em>[Guide 7]</em>. These may determine what degree of sovereignty is ceded (not all European nations have joined EU, for instance).</p>
<p>Positive responses to globalization can thus be weighed against the fear of possible losses, costs and challenges. Any conclusion reached will be context-dependent. The arguments may be different for an account focused on the EU, in comparison to a discussion of NAFTA or MERCOSUR.</p>
<p>Band C answers describe a narrow range of responses that are linked to globalization or may explain why sovereignty is lost/threatened (but do not link this to the responses of particular actors). At the upper end of this level, there may be a simple, assertive conclusion based on a narrow synthesis of information.</p>
<p>For band D there should be a synthesis of several evidenced themes taken from the subject guide or a conclusion that reflects on a range of responses (perhaps weighing the net balance of positive and negative responses, or taking into account the differing perspectives of different actors). At band E, expect both of these elements (both synthesis and some proper evaluation).</p>

<p>This topic is clearly taught very differently by different centres. Some regard McDonaldization as a form of imperialism (in the neo-colonial mould), whereas others see it as a more pervasive form of cultural diffusion (on the basis that no-one is forced to eat a Big Mac at gunpoint). Either political view is fine, provided it can be justified and argued. Some good answers linked the diffusion/imperialism distinction with inequalities in power (that is, they contrasted an essentially one-way exchange, imperialism, with a two-way exchange of culture, diffusion). Another popular interpretation involved analysing cultural imperialism as the way culture is &ldquo;rolled out&rdquo; globally by powerful TNCs, whereas cultural diffusion was explained as being the &ldquo;grass roots&rdquo; embracing of traits belonging to migrant/diaspora groups by the wider population. Again, this was a fine approach to take if it could be argued coherently. In conclusion, there was no definitive &ldquo;right&rdquo; answer here; rather, there was an entire spectrum of &ldquo;right&rdquo; answers. &ldquo;Wrong&rdquo; answers, in contrast to these, typically tended to be self-contradictory (that is, the actions of TNCs were described as being both imperialism and diffusion, with no actual distinction made).</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>The subject guide (part 3, section 6) provides a teaching focus on geopolitical aspects of the loss of sovereignty (that is, the creation of MGOs) but also widens the geographical inquiry to encompass the power of TNCs. Thus, the cultural imperialism concept can be used in this wider context too, and many candidates made the connection. But it was a shame that some of those who chose this topic did not grasp the centrality of MGOs to the discussion at all, and knew little about the geopolitics of trade bloc membership and the mixed reaction of civil society. Some other weak responses did not answer the question directly and instead wrote only about how loss of sovereignty happens, not what the &ldquo;range of responses&rdquo; to this then are. Thus, they could write about English language spreading globally and threatening other tongues but did not, for instance, examine the response of either the French or Chinese government to this (setting quotas for the amount of foreign-language music, or films, respectively). In contrast, the best answers were properly synthetic and covered all of the key themes. Some showed very good current affairs knowledge of events in Greece and the Eurozone, or of &ldquo;resource nationalism&rdquo; (another reaction) in South America.</p>

<p>Friction of distance is the barrier to the exchange of goods, services, ideas created by slow/limited/expensive transport. Over time, increased connectivity through&nbsp;transport has reduced friction of distance (changing our perception of time/space&nbsp;barriers).</p>
<p>Candidates may explore the relationship through the use of a timeline, and perhaps a&nbsp;diagram, showing how transport times have fallen as a result of successive transport&nbsp;&ldquo;revolutions&rdquo; (bicycle, boat, car train, &rsquo;plane, <em>etc</em>). Also credit accompanying technologies&nbsp;<em>eg</em> refrigeration for perishables and intermodal transport. Candidates&nbsp;may be familiar with the associated geographical concept of time&ndash;space convergence&nbsp;(in other words, we perceive that we inhabit a &ldquo;shrinking world&rdquo; as distant places&nbsp;&ldquo;feel&rdquo; nearer). Done well, this could be sufficient for the higher mark bands.</p>
<p>A different approach might be to look at more detailed case studies of particular&nbsp;technologies and their application (<em>eg</em> the speed with which flowers from Kenya are&nbsp;flown to Europe; or the speed with which containers can bring manufactured goods&nbsp;from EPZs in China to the USA). This approach is sufficient for band D even if the&nbsp;&ldquo;relationship&rdquo; is not particularly clear.</p>
<p>Finally, the subject guide specifies that candidates should have studied speed and&nbsp;capacity changes for <em>two</em> types of transport network. They might draw on this as part&nbsp;of their answer. However, they should be careful to focus on the reduced friction of<br>distance as the network is modernized, or extended into areas that were previously&nbsp;&ldquo;switched off&rdquo; (and thus took a longer time to reach).</p>
<p>Credit may be given for some discussion of the role that telecom networks play in&nbsp;transporting data and information, &ldquo;eradicating&rdquo; the friction of distance altogether.</p>
<p>Band C answers are likely to describe some specific details of transport history, but&nbsp;with little/no development of &ldquo;friction of distance&rdquo; (besides saying it has lessened).</p>
<p>At band D, expect <span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> a clearer explanation of the changing relationship over time&nbsp;(may use the concept of time&ndash;space convergence) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> effective use of detailed&nbsp;examples to explain how transport connects distant places together with reduced<br>travel time.</p>

<p>The focus should be national (or group) identity although credit can be given for&nbsp;groups within a nation <em>eg</em> Amish (USA), Welsh (UK), tribes (Amazon). Discussion&nbsp;of a diaspora&rsquo;s &ldquo;national&rdquo; identity (<em>eg</em> the identity of the Chinese in USA) may also&nbsp;be credited. Expect candidates to take a range of approaches and to hold a range of&nbsp;views about what factors or processes make a place distinctive/less distinctive.</p>
<p>Possible themes for discussion in agreement with the statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>a range of issues can be discussed pertaining to cultural dilution/cultural&nbsp;imperialism/immigration/multiculturalism <em>[Guide 5]</em>. Different cultural traits&nbsp;may be discussed <em>eg</em> language, diet, music, religion, <em>etc</em></li>
<li>evidence may be cited in support of the proposition that increasing cultural&nbsp;homogeneity is unavoidable/irreversible, for instance international migration or&nbsp;the spread of branded commodities <em>[Guide 5]</em> or the homogenization of&nbsp;urban/cultural landscapes <em>[Guide 4]</em></li>
<li>sovereign states risk losing political autonomy due to their membership of MGOs&nbsp;(especially the case for the EU) or in relation to wealth/leverage of TNCs&nbsp;<em>[Guide 6]</em>, influence of IMF/World Bank <em>[Guide 3]</em>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible themes for discussion in disagreement with the statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>many countries have experienced a resurgence in nationalism/regionalism&nbsp;<em>[Guide 6]</em>, for instance as evidenced by programmes of nationalization (Bolivia)&nbsp;or attempts to limit the dominance of English (in France&rsquo;s case)</li>
<li>there are instances of states or societies opting out of globalization/isolationism&nbsp;(<em>eg</em>, China&rsquo;s stance on internet access; North Korea or until recently Myanmar;&nbsp;Amish communities in USA) <em>[Guide 7]</em></li>
<li>glocalized/hybrid outcomes can still be highly distinctive or unique<em> [Guide 7]</em>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>A more critical, thoughtful or nuanced response might take the view that:</p>
<ul>
<li>national identity has many aspects, not all of which are threatened, <em>eg</em>, by MGO&nbsp;membership <em>[Guide 6]</em></li>
<li>other foci for identity may be becoming more important than national identity for&nbsp;many people, <em>eg</em>, diaspora identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>At band C, some impacts on national/group identity/culture should be described and&nbsp;linked with global interactions such as migration, information flow <em>etc.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Band D should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> provide a wider and more balanced discussion of the statement&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> offer a more critical discussion of what is meant by &ldquo;distinctive national identity&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friction of distance&rdquo; and transport innovation appears to be a well-understood and well-learned area of the curriculum. Even the weakest candidates were able to provide a short descriptive account of different modes of transport improving over time (in terms of the reduced time taken to move people or goods between locations). Many had learned the topic in advance in some depth, with accompanying locational details and data. This was not, however, always sufficient to reach the highest markband available. Some conceptual sophistication was also expected, such as clear, well-explained linkages with the concept of time&ndash;space convergence (or time&ndash;space compression). Alternatively, greater geographical knowledge was expected of how, in context, the friction of distance has lessened for specific global flows, such as commodity movements, thereby linking specific locales (such as the flower farms sited around Lake Naivasha, Kenya and the flower markets near Old Street, London, England). In contrast, band C answers often provided greater detail of, say, the technical specifications of jet engines, yet went on to merely assert that this allows &ldquo;people&rdquo; to &ldquo;move around the world quicker&rdquo;.</p>

Arranged in a way that provided both support for, and rejection of, the statement, this was usually sufficient for band D.

<p>Financial flows include movements of money/credit/investment. Strictly, they should not include movements of goods/raw materials, although in reality there is some overlap (investments by TNCs underpin to flows of goods) and where appropriate the benefit of the doubt should be given.</p>
<p>National governments may <span style="text-decoration: underline;">directly</span> transfer money via international aid programmes (bilateral or multilateral contributions), loans (including sovereign wealth funds) and investment (state-owned companies may purchase assets abroad).
